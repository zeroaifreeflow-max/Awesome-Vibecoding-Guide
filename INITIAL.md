# Feature Request — Awesome Vibecoding Guide

## FEATURE:

[Describe what you want to add to the guide — be specific about topic, target audience, and what the reader should learn.
Bad:  "Add marketing section"
Good: "Add a guide for Thai freelancers on pricing AI automation services for local restaurants, including sample proposals in Thai and typical Thai SME budgets"]

## EXAMPLES:

[Point to existing content that the new section should follow as reference.
- Which existing playbook or guide is most similar?
- Which files demonstrate the patterns to follow?
- Example: "Follow the same pattern as docs/02-websites-playbook/pricing-economics.md for structure, frontmatter, and cross-referencing"]

## DOCUMENTATION:

[List any external resources the AI should reference during writing.
- Industry reports, market data, competitor guides
- Official tool/framework docs
- Internal docs that provide context]

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

[Anything else the AI should know:
- Does this need new routing entries in docs/_index/map.md?
- Should new agent commands be created or updated?
- Are there cross-references to add to existing files?
- Is this Thai-market specific or universal?
- Does this need new case study templates?]
