# The Delivery System

> How to execute any vibecoding project with quality and efficiency.

This section contains the cross-cutting skills that apply to **every revenue stream** — whether you're building websites, automations, or micro-SaaS.

## Core Components

### [Workflow & Process](workflow/README.md)
Your step-by-step execution system:
- **Phase 0**: Preparation — Tool setup, mindset
- **Phase 1**: Planning — Specs, PRDs, scope
- **Phase 2**: Development — Implementation workflow
- **Phase 3**: Testing & Debugging — QA process
- **Phase 4**: Deployment — Ship it
- **Git Safety**: Protect your work from AI disasters
- **Git Strategies**: Two-phase workflow

### [Quality Standards](quality-standards/README.md)
What separates amateur from professional:
- **Accessibility** — WCAG compliance
- **SEO** — Search optimization
- **Performance** — Speed and efficiency
- **Design Consistency** — Professional appearance
- **Quality Gates** — Pre-ship checklist

**Remember**: Quality justifies premium pricing.

### [Prompting for Outcomes](prompting/README.md)
Communicate effectively with AI:
- **Foundations** — Anatomy of good prompts
- **Task-Specific Patterns** — Feature dev, debugging, refactoring
- **Quality-Focused Prompts** — Professional output
- **Template Library** — Ready-to-use prompts

### [Context Management](context-management/README.md)
Keep AI effective over long sessions:
- Lean context principles
- Advanced scenarios

### [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/README.md)
When things go wrong:
- **Human Context Debugging** — 95% of issues are context failures
- **Recovery Patterns** — Get back on track
- **Quick Reference** — Symptom → solution lookup

## Why This Matters

The delivery system is your **margin protection**:
- Faster delivery = higher hourly rate
- Fewer bugs = less unpaid rework
- Quality output = premium pricing
- Systematic process = scalable operation
