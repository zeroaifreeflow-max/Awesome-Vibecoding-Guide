### The Quality Foundation
```
       Design Consistency
              |
              |  (Systematic approach)
              |
      Accessibility
          /   \
         /     \
        /       \
       /         \
   SEO --------- Performance
```

**Key Insight:** Design consistency provides the foundation for all other quality pillars. A systematic approach to design naturally leads to better accessibility, SEO, and performance. When you build with consistent patterns and standards, professional quality follows.
