# Phase 5: Deployment 🚢

**Tools:** CI/CD platform + Hosting provider

**Prerequisites:** Ensure [Phase 3: Testing & Debugging](./phase-3-testing-debugging.md) is complete and all [Quality Standards](../quality-standards/README.md) are met before deployment.

## Recommended Platforms

### Cloudflare Pages/Workers ⭐ **Best for Professional Projects**

**Cloudflare Pages** (Static Sites)
- **Completely free hosting** - no bandwidth limits, no visitor caps
- **Built-in CI/CD** - automatic deployments from Git repositories
- **Global CDN** - instant caching and fast loading worldwide
- **Custom domains** free with SSL certificates
- **Edge functions** for dynamic content without a separate backend

**Cloudflare Workers** (Serverless Backend)
- **100,000 requests/day free** - enough for most business websites
- **Pay-as-you-go beyond that** - $0.15 per million additional requests
- **Global edge network** - low latency worldwide
- **Durable objects** for real-time applications
- **KV storage** for key-value data

**Why it's perfect for client projects:**
- **Predictable costs** - you know exactly what you'll pay
- **Enterprise-grade infrastructure** - used by major companies
- **No surprise bills** - usage is predictable and billing is transparent
- **Professional reliability** - 99.9%+ uptime guarantee
- **Scalability** - handles traffic spikes without additional cost

### GitHub Pages 🆓 **Best for Personal/Portfolio Projects**

**Completely free for:**
- Static websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Personal portfolios
- Open source project documentation
- Experimental side projects

**Limitations:**
- **Static only** - no server-side processing
- **GitHub branding** on free plans
- **Build time limits** (10 minutes)
- **Not suitable for client work** - lacks professional SLA and support
- **Custom domain setup** requires manual DNS configuration

**Perfect for:**
- Learning developers building their first projects
- Personal portfolios and blogs
- Open source documentation
- Hobby projects where cost is the primary concern

### Vercel/Netlify 🚀 **Best (performance wise) for Interactive Next.js Applications**

**Vercel**
- **Optimized for Next.js** - best performance and features
- **Server-side rendering** and API routes supported
- **Edge functions** for compute-heavy operations
- **Free tier limitations:**
  - 100GB bandwidth/month
  - Limited serverless function execution time
  - Usage-based pricing can add up quickly

**Netlify**
- **Great for Jamstack sites**
- **Forms handling** and serverless functions
- **Build plugins** ecosystem
- **Similar free tier limitations** to Vercel

**⚠️ Cost Warning for Client Projects:**
- **Usage-based billing** can become expensive with traffic
- **Serverless functions** charge per invocation and execution time
- **Bandwidth overages** can lead to surprise bills
- **Not predictable** - costs scale with user engagement

**When to use:**
- **Client projects** with **defined budgets** and **traffic expectations**
- **Next.js applications** that require server-side features
- **Projects where performance justifies the cost**
- **Applications with clear monetization strategies**


## CI/CD Implementation

### Automated Deployment Pipeline

**Standard Workflow:**
```bash
# Development
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add user authentication"

      { status: 500, headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }
    );
  }
}
```

## Backup & Rollback Strategy

### Database Backup

**Automated Backups:**
```sql
-- Daily backup script
pg_dump production_db > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

-- Upload to cloud storage
aws s3 cp backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql s3://backups-bucket/
```

**Manual Backup Process:**
1. Create database dump
2. Upload to cloud storage (S3, R2, etc.)
3. Test restore process
4. Document backup retention policy

### Rollback Procedures

**Application Rollback:**
```bash
# Git-based rollback
git revert HEAD~2..HEAD
git push origin main

# Or revert to specific deployment
cf pages deployment list --project-name=my-project
cf pages deployment rollback --project-name=my-project --deployment=<id>
```

**Database Rollback:**
```bash
# Restore from backup
psql production_db < backup_20231201.sql

# Point application to restored database
# Update environment variables if needed
```

- **FID (First Input Delay)**: < 100ms
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: < 0.1

**Optimization Checklist:**
- [ ] Images optimized and compressed
- [ ] CSS and JavaScript minified
- [ ] Caching headers configured
- [ ] CDN properly configured
- [ ] Database queries optimized

### CDN Configuration

**Cloudflare CDN:**
```javascript
// Cache static assets for 1 year
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url)
  
  // Cache static assets
  if (url.pathname.match(/\.(js|css|png|jpg|gif|ico|svg)$/)) {
    const cacheKey = new Request(url.toString(), request)
    const cachedResponse = await caches.default.match(cacheKey)
    
    if (cachedResponse) {
      return cachedResponse
    }
    
    const response = await fetch(request)
    const cacheResponse = new Response(response.body, response)
    cacheResponse.headers.set('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=31536000')
    
    return cacheResponse
  }
  
  return fetch(request)
}
```

## Deployment Troubleshooting

**Common problems during deployment and their solutions**

### Build Failures

**Symptom:** Build process fails with errors not present in development.

**Common causes:**
- Environment variable missing
- Dependency version mismatch
- Build optimization issues
- Memory/resource limits

**Quick fix:**
```
"Build failing in production but works in development:

BUILD ERROR:
[error message from build log]

ENVIRONMENT:
- Development: Node 18.16.0, works fine
- Production: [platform, Node version]

RECENT CHANGES:
[what was changed before failure]

Check:
1. Environment variables (are all set in production?)
2. Dependency versions (package-lock.json committed?)
3. Build configuration (vite.config.ts, next.config.js, etc.)
4. Memory limits (increase if needed)
5. Missing files (.gitignore hiding required files?)"
```

**Prevention:**
- Test build locally: `npm run build`
- Commit package-lock.json/yarn.lock
- Document all required environment variables
- Test in staging environment first

---

### Environment-Specific Issues

**Symptom:** Code works locally but fails in production.

**Quick diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check environment variables
"List all environment variables used in code"

# Check configuration differences
"Compare development vs production configs"

# Check dependencies
"Check if all dependencies available in production"
```

**Quick fix:**
```
"Works in development, fails in production:

ERROR IN PRODUCTION:
[error message]

ENVIRONMENT DIFFERENCES:
Development:
- Database: localhost:5432
- API URL: http://localhost:3000
- Node ENV: development

Production:
- Database: [production DB URL]
- API URL: [production URL]
- Node ENV: production

SUSPECTED ISSUE:
[What might be different]

Debug and fix environment-specific issue."
```

**Common environment issues:**
- Database connection strings
- API endpoints (localhost vs production)
- CORS configuration
- File paths (absolute vs relative)
- SSL/HTTPS requirements

---

### DNS/Domain Problems

**Symptom:** Domain not pointing to deployment, or SSL certificate issues.

**Quick diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check DNS propagation
dig yourdomain.com
nslookup yourdomain.com

# Check DNS records
# Should show:
# A record → Your server IP
# or CNAME → Your hosting platform
```

**Quick fix (Cloudflare Pages):**
```
1. Add custom domain in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Add DNS records:
   - yourdomain.com → CNAME → your-project.pages.dev
   - www.yourdomain.com → CNAME → your-project.pages.dev
3. Enable "Automatic HTTPS Rewrites"
4. Wait for SSL certificate (5-30 minutes)
5. Test: https://yourdomain.com
```

**Prevention:**
- Set up DNS before announcing site
- Wait 24-48h for full DNS propagation
- Test both www and non-www versions
- Enable SSL/HTTPS from start

---

### Deployment Pipeline Failures

**Symptom:** CI/CD pipeline fails during deployment.

**Quick diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check pipeline logs
# Look for:
- Failed tests
- Build errors
- Deployment errors
- Permission issues
```

**Quick fix:**
```
"CI/CD pipeline failing:

PIPELINE LOG:
[relevant error from CI/CD]

STAGE THAT FAILS:
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Build
- [ ] Deploy
- [ ] Post-deploy checks

SUSPECTED CAUSE:
[hypothesis]

Fix the pipeline configuration."
```

**Common pipeline issues:**
- Tests failing in CI but passing locally
- Missing environment variables in CI
- Different Node/dependency versions
- Insufficient permissions
- Timeout limits exceeded

---

### Performance Degradation After Deployment

**Symptom:** Site is slow in production despite being fast locally.

**Quick diagnosis:**
```
Use Chrome DevTools (on production site):
1. Open Network tab
2. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check:
   - Total load time
   - Largest requests
   - Failed requests
   - Slow API calls

Use Lighthouse:
1. Run Lighthouse audit
2. Check Core Web Vitals:
   - LCP (should be <2.5s)
   - FID (should be <100ms)
   - CLS (should be <0.1)
```

**Quick fixes:**
```
Common performance issues in production:

1. Images not optimized
   - Solution: Use image optimization service
   - Solution: Use modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
   - Solution: Implement lazy loading

2. No caching
   - Solution: Configure cache headers
   - Solution: Enable CDN caching
   - Solution: Use service workers

3. Slow API calls
   - Solution: Add database indexes
   - Solution: Implement caching (Redis)
   - Solution: Use CDN for static data

4. Large bundle sizes
   - Solution: Code splitting
   - Solution: Tree shaking
   - Solution: Remove unused dependencies

5. No compression
   - Solution: Enable gzip/brotli compression
   - Solution: Configure in hosting platform
```

---

### Database Connection Issues

**Symptom:** Can't connect to database from production.

**Quick fix:**
```
"Database connection failing in production:

ERROR:
[connection error message]

CONFIGURATION:
- Database host: [host]
- Port: [port]
- SSL required: [yes/no]
- Firewall rules: [configured?]

CONNECTION STRING:
[connection string with password redacted]

Check:
1. Database server running and accessible
2. Firewall allows connections from production server
3. Database credentials correct in environment variables
4. SSL/TLS configured if required
5. Connection pool settings appropriate
6. Database not at connection limit"
```

**Prevention:**
- Test database connection from production environment before deploying
- Use connection pooling
- Set reasonable connection limits
- Monitor connection count
- Enable database logs for debugging

---

### Rollback Procedures

**When to rollback:**
- Critical bug discovered in production
- Performance severely degraded
- Data corruption risk
- Security vulnerability

**Quick rollback (Cloudflare Pages):**
```bash
# Via Dashboard:
1. Go to Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Select your project
3. View deployments
4. Click "Rollback" on previous stable deployment

# Via CLI:
wrangler pages deployment list
wrangler pages deployment rollback [DEPLOYMENT_ID]
```

**Quick rollback (Git-based):**
```bash
# Find last good commit
git log --oneline

# Revert to last good commit
git revert [bad-commit-hash]
git push origin main

# Or hard reset (if safe)
git reset --hard [last-good-commit]
git push --force origin main
```

**After rollback:**
1. Notify users if needed
2. Document what went wrong
3. Fix issue in development
4. Test thoroughly
5. Deploy fix
