# Workflow & Process 🔄

Vibecoding across five phases—from vibecoder preparation through deployment. The modern workflow starts with preparing yourself as a vibecoder, validating ideas, then using specialized tools like OpenSpec for project kickoff.

## The Modern Vibecoding Flow

**Vibecoder Preparation** → Set up your mindset, tools, and validate ideas → Phase 0 complete
**Idea Validation** → Research market, validate with Reddit/Perplexity → Confirmed opportunity  
**Planning** → Feed validated ideas into OpenSpec with infrastructure details → Generate project structure
**Environment Setup** → Configure your IDE, coding agents, and MCP servers
**Development** → Implement features systematically with AI assistance
**Testing & Refinement** → Debug, review, refactor, and deploy

## Phases
- [Phase 0: Vibecoder Preparation](./phase-0-vibecoder-preparation.md) - Mindset setup, tool preparation, idea validation, and cost-effective development strategy
- [Phase 1: Planning (Pre‑Development)](./phase-1-planning.md) - External chat ideation, PRD creation, OpenSpec project kickoff
- [Phase 2: Development](./phase-2-development.md) - Environment setup and feature implementation
- [Phase 3: Testing, Debugging & Code Review](./phase-3-testing-debugging.md) - Automated testing, debugging, and code quality improvements
- [Phase 4: Deployment](./phase-4-deployment.md) - CI/CD and production deployment

## Cost-Effective Development

**You DON'T need to spend $200+ to start vibecoding!**

### Free Option (Perfect for Beginners)
- **Tools**: Qwen CLI + VS Code + MCP servers
- **Cost**: $0/month
- **Capabilities**: Full-stack web development, APIs, databases
- **Commercial Viability**: Yes, can deliver professional websites and applications

### Budget Option (Professional Grade) - RECOMMENDED
- **Tools**: GLM Lite / Synthetic Standard + Zed + MCP servers
- **Cost**: $3-20/month (main recommended range)
- **Capabilities**: Enhanced AI assistance, better integrations
- **Commercial Viability**: Enterprise-level project delivery
- **Note**: GLM Lite ($3/mo) sufficient for most users, GLM Pro ($15/mo) only for heavy usage. Check [current GLM pricing](https://z.ai/subscribe?ic=CUEFJ9ALMX)

### Premium Option
- **Tools**: Advanced AI providers + premium integrations
- **Cost**: $30-50/month
- **When to use**: Heavier workloads or specialized requirements
- **Note**: Not required for commercial-quality work

### Experimentation Only ($50+/month)
- **Cost**: $50-100+/month
- **Only recommended if**: You're comfortable with this spend and want to experiment with multiple premium providers
- **Important**: This range is for experimentation only - stick to $0-20 for optimal ROI

**Key Insight**: The LLM model matters less than your technique. With proper vibecoding methods, even free tools can deliver commercial-quality results.
