# Offer Design

> A confused buyer doesn't buy. Make your offer crystal clear.

## Productized vs Custom Work

| Approach | Productized Services | Custom Work |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| Scope | Fixed | Negotiated |
| Price | Fixed | Quoted |
| Timeline | Predictable | Variable |
| Scalability | High | Low |
| Client quality | Better | Mixed |
| Stress level | Lower | Higher |

**The goal**: Move toward productized services. Custom work pays more per project but burns you out.

## Productized Offer Examples

- Homepage, About, Services, Contact, one custom page

**What's NOT included** (upsells):
- Additional pages ($75 each)
- Blog setup ($150)
- Booking integration ($200)
- Monthly maintenance ($50/month)

### Automations

**The "Lead Capture System" Package**
- Form to CRM integration
- Automated email response
- Notification to owner

- Dashboard for tracking
- **$800 setup + $100/month maintenance**

**What's NOT included**:
- Custom CRM setup ($300)

### Micro-SaaS (Client Upsell)

**Simple Booking System for Your Mechanic Client**
- Available time slots per day
- Customers pick open slots
- Admin manages availability
- SMS/email notifications
- **$150/month (replaces their $200/month Calendly)**

Note: This isn't sold to "the market" — it's built for an existing client who already trusts you.

## How to Package Your Services

### Step 1: Define the Core Deliverable
What's the one thing every client gets? Be specific.

❌ "I build websites"
✅ "I build 5-page business websites with contact forms, delivered in 7 days"

### Step 2: Set Fixed Scope
List exactly what's included. If it's not on the list, it's extra.

### Step 3: Create Tiers (Optional)
Three tiers work well:

| Tier | Websites Example | Price |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| Basic | 3 pages, template design | $300 |
| Standard | 5 pages, custom design | $500 |
| Premium | 8 pages, booking, blog | $900 |

### Step 4: Define Boundaries
Write this down and share it with every client:

> "This package includes X, Y, and Z. Additional requests like A, B, or C are available as add-ons."

## Preventing Scope Creep

Scope creep kills projects and relationships. Prevent it:

### Before the Project
1. Send a detailed scope document
2. Get written approval before starting
3. Quote add-ons in advance ("If you want X later, it's $Y")

### During the Project
1. Track all requests
2. Respond to out-of-scope requests with: "Great idea. That's outside our current scope. I can add it for $X. Want me to?"
3. Never do "quick favors" — they become expectations

### The Magic Phrase
> "I can definitely do that. It's outside the current project, so it would be [price]. Want me to add it?"

No apology. No hesitation. Just a clear offer.

## The Productization Path

**Month 1-2**: Custom work (learn what clients actually need)
**Month 3-4**: Semi-productized (standard scope, custom pricing)
**Month 5+**: Fully productized (fixed scope, fixed price)

Start custom to learn. Move to productized to scale.
