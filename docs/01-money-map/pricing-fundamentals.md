# Pricing Fundamentals

> Price based on value delivered, not hours worked. Never hourly.

## Pricing Models by Revenue Stream

| Stream | Model | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Websites | One-time | $500 per site |
| Automations | Setup + Retainer | $800 setup + $100/month |
| Micro-SaaS | Subscription | $29/month per user |

## Why Never Hourly

Hourly pricing punishes efficiency.

| Approach | Your time | Client pays | Your hourly |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Hourly ($50/hr) | 10 hours | $500 | $50/hr |
| Fixed ($500) | 10 hours | $500 | $50/hr |
| Fixed ($500) | 4 hours (you got faster) | $500 | $125/hr |

As you improve, fixed pricing rewards you. Hourly doesn't.

Also: Clients hate hourly. They can't budget. Every email feels like the meter is running.

## Calculating Your Rates

### Step 1: Set Your Income Target
What do you need monthly? Be specific.

Example: $4,000/month side income

### Step 2: Calculate Available Hours
How many hours can you actually work on client projects?

Example: 20 hours/week × 4 weeks = 80 hours/month

### Step 3: Account for Non-Billable Time
Only 50-60% of your time is billable (rest is marketing, admin, communication).

Example: 80 hours × 0.5 = 40 billable hours

### Step 4: Find Your Minimum Rate
$4,000 ÷ 40 hours = $100/hour minimum

### Step 5: Price Your Packages
If a website takes 6 hours: 6 × $100 = $600 minimum price

**But don't tell the client this.** Price based on value, not your math.

## Market Positioning

| Position | Websites | Automations | Target Client |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Budget | $200-400 | $300-600 | Price shoppers, small ops |
| Mid-tier | $500-800 | $800-1,500 | Serious businesses |
| Premium | $1,000-2,500 | $2,000-5,000 | Established companies |

**Recommendation**: Start mid-tier. Budget clients are more work for less money. Premium requires proven results.

## Raising Prices Over Time

### When to Raise Prices
- You're booked 2+ weeks out
- Clients say yes too easily (< 20% negotiate)
- Your quality has improved measurably
- You have testimonials and portfolio

### How Much to Raise
10-25% per increase. Do this every 3-6 months until you hit resistance.

### How to Implement
- New clients get new prices immediately
- Existing clients get 30-day notice
- Grandfather loyal clients if you want (but don't feel obligated)

### The Script
> "Starting [date], my rates are increasing to [new price]. Current projects aren't affected. Let me know if you'd like to lock in current rates for any upcoming work."

## Common Pricing Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Pricing Too Low
**Why it hurts**: Attracts bad clients, burns you out, hard to raise later.
**Fix**: Double your rate. See what happens. You'll lose some leads and keep better ones.

### Mistake 2: Quoting Before Understanding
**Why it hurts**: You'll underprice complex work.
**Fix**: Always have a discovery call before quoting. Ask about goals, timeline, complexity.

### Mistake 3: Discounting
**Why it hurts**: Trains clients to ask for discounts. Devalues your work.
**Fix**: Hold the price. Add value instead ("I'll include X at this price").

### Mistake 4: Not Charging for Scope Changes
**Why it hurts**: Projects expand, your rate drops.
**Fix**: Every addition has a price. Quote it immediately.

### Mistake 5: Comparing to Cheap Alternatives
**Why it hurts**: Race to the bottom.
**Fix**: Compete on speed, quality, and reliability — not price.

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchor High
Mention your premium option first. Makes standard seem reasonable.

> "My full-service package is $1,200. Most clients choose the $600 standard package."

### Use Specific Numbers
$497 feels more considered than $500. $847 beats $850.

### Bundle Value
Don't itemize. Show one price for the outcome.

❌ "Design: $200, Development: $200, Setup: $100"
✅ "Complete business website: $500"

### Show the Alternative Cost
What would they pay without you?

> "A local agency would charge $3,000-5,000 for this. You're getting the same result for $700."

## Practical Examples

### Website Pricing Scenario
- Client: Local restaurant
- Scope: 5-page site with menu, contact form, reservation link
- Your time: ~5 hours
- Your price: $500

Client value: A professional website that brings in $200/month in new customers. They'll earn back your fee in 3 months. Your price is low compared to the value.

### Automation Pricing Scenario
- Client: HVAC company
- Scope: Lead capture → CRM → auto-response → tech assignment
- Your time: ~10 hours setup, 2 hours/month maintenance
- Your price: $1,200 setup + $150/month

Client value: Saves 10 hours/week of admin work. That's $1,000/month in labor. They're paying $150/month to save $1,000. Easy yes.
