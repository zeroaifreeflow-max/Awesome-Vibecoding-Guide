# Choosing Your Path

> Pick one. Master it. Then expand.

## The Three Paths

| Path | Best For | Time to First $ | Risk Level | Monthly Potential |
|------|----------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Websites** | Beginners, quick wins | 1-2 weeks | Low | $1,500-3,000 |
| **Automations** | Technical builders | 2-4 weeks | Medium | $3,000-8,000 |
| **Micro-SaaS** | Experienced builders with clients | 1-2 weeks | Low-Medium | $500-2,000+ |

## Self-Assessment

Answer honestly:

### Skills
- Can you build a basic website from a template? → Websites
- Can you connect APIs and build workflows? → Automations
- Can you ship and maintain software? → Micro-SaaS

### Available Time
- 5-10 hours/week? → Websites (project-based)
- 15-20 hours/week? → Automations (client work)
- 15-20 hours/week? → Micro-SaaS (building + light support)

### Prerequisites
- Just starting out? → Websites
- Have some dev skills? → Automations
- Already have clients? → Micro-SaaS (upsell opportunity)

### Goals
- Side income, low stress? → Websites
- Replace job income? → Automations
- Recurring revenue from existing clients? → Micro-SaaS

## Decision Tree

```
Do you need money in the next 2 weeks?
├── YES → Start with Websites
└── NO → Do you have technical experience?
    ├── NO → Start with Websites (build skills)
    └── YES → Do you already have clients?
        ├── NO → Automations (build client base)
        └── YES → Have you seen their pain points?
            ├── YES → Micro-SaaS (upsell a tool)
            └── NO → Automations (learn their workflows)
```

## Warning Signs by Path

### Websites — Watch Out If You:
- Hate client communication
- Can't handle revision requests
- Expect $5k+ per project immediately

### Automations — Watch Out If You:
- Don't understand business workflows
- Can't explain tech to non-technical clients
- Haven't built anything beyond tutorials

### Micro-SaaS — Watch Out If You:
- Don't have existing clients yet (start with websites/automations first)
- Build features nobody asked for
- Can't maintain software long-term (support burden)

## The Clear Recommendation

**Start with websites.**

Even if you want to build automations or SaaS eventually.

Why:
1. **Fastest feedback loop** — Ship in days, get paid in weeks
2. **Client skills transfer** — Learn to sell, communicate, deliver
3. **Low stakes practice** — Mistakes cost hours, not months
4. **Portfolio builder** — Real work to show future clients

Once you've delivered 3-5 websites:
- You understand client expectations
- You have cash flow
- You can take bigger risks

## Moving Between Paths

Your path isn't permanent. Many builders follow this progression:

**Month 1-3**: Websites → Build skills, get clients, earn cash
**Month 4-6**: Websites + Automations → Upsell existing clients
**Month 6-12**: Automations → Higher value, recurring revenue
**Month 9+**: Micro-SaaS → Spot client pain, upsell tiny tools

The best Micro-SaaS opportunities come from client work. You don't need to find customers — you already have them.
