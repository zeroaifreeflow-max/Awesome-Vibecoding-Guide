## Recommended: Zed.dev — Primary IDE

**Primary IDE** — Fast, modern, BYOK-friendly.

- Native speed (Rust-based)
- Built-in AI features with BYOK support
- Multi-cursor, collaborative editing
- Clean, distraction-free interface

### AI-First Architecture

- **AI-native IDE** — built from the ground up for AI work, not retrofitted with AI capabilities
- **Built-in AI agent** handles all vibecoding workflows seamlessly from scratch after a plain install
- **Hassle-free agent configuration** — no complex setup required, works right out of the box
- **Native support for any AI agent** with zero configuration headaches
- **Context-aware intelligence** that understands your coding patterns and workflow needs

### Extreme Performance & Speed

- **Most performant IDE** on the market with unmatched speed when working with AI agents
- **Lightweight architecture** — uses only 20% of VS Code's resources for similar tasks
- **Seamless development experience** with instant responses and zero lag during AI-assisted coding
- **Optimized for AI workflows** — every interaction with AI agents feels instantaneous
- **Real-time collaboration** between human and AI without performance bottlenecks

### Developer Experience

- **Zero friction setup** — install and start vibecoding immediately
- **Super frequent updates** of the IDE itself, with major updates also improving the IDE significantly
- **Excellent context management** — built-in AI agent keeps context clean and relevant
- **Easy integration** — connect to any LLM via API without complex configuration
- **Advanced agent features** — great for longer tasks with automatic tracking and context preservation

### Cost Efficiency & Accessibility

- **Completely free to use** with no premium tiers or feature restrictions
- **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** model — use your preferred AI service without vendor lock-in
- **Perfect partnership with GLM Coding Plan** for budget-conscious developers
- **Cost-effective combo** — Zed + GLM provides enterprise-level AI coding at minimal cost
- **No subscription fees** — pay only for the AI services you choose to use

### Key Resource Management Advantages

- **Efficient token utilization** — leverage up to 85% of the LLM's token capacity effectively
- **Clean context management** — no plugin clutter, pure coding environment
- **Automatic context compression** — when conversations near limits, the agent intelligently compresses dialog while preserving intent
- **Memory-efficient operations** — seamless handling of large codebases without performance degradation
- **Smart context pruning** — automatically removes irrelevant information while keeping critical coding context

### Perfect for Vibecoding Workflows

- **Built for AI-assisted development** — every feature optimized for human-AI collaboration
- **Instant productivity** — no learning curve, start vibecoding immediately after installation
- **Scalable performance** — maintains speed even with complex, AI-heavy workflows
- **Developer-focused design** — created by developers who understand modern AI-powered coding needs
