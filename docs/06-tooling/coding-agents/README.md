# Coding Agents

> AI-powered coding assistants that do the heavy lifting.

## Recommended Agents

| Agent | Best For | Cost |
|-------|----------|------|
| **[Claude Code CLI](claude-code-cli.md)** | Primary agent, plan mode, multi-agent | BYOK |
| **[AMP](#ampcode--free-version)** | Free alternative, powerful | Free tier available |
| **[OpenCode](opencode.md)** | With oh-my-opencode extension | BYOK |
| **[Antigravity](antigravity.md)** | Generous quotas | Free tier |

## My Daily Setup

1. **Claude Code CLI** — Primary agent for most work
2. **AMP** — Free option, especially good for certain tasks
3. **OpenCode + oh-my-opencode** — When I need specific integrations
4. **Antigravity** — For heavy usage when quota matters

## How to Choose

- **Starting out?** → Claude Code CLI or AMP (free)
- **Budget constrained?** → AMP + Antigravity
- **Heavy usage?** → Claude Code CLI + provider subscription
- **Need IDE integration?** → OpenCode with ZED

## BYOK Setup

All agents support connecting your own API keys:
- Synthetic.new API
- MiniMax API
- GLM API
- Or other OpenAI-compatible providers

See individual tool pages for configuration.
