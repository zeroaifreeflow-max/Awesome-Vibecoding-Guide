# Antigravity

> Web-based coding agent with generous free quotas — your safety net for heavy development days.

## Overview

[Antigravity](https://antigravity.ai/) is a web-based AI coding agent that offers substantial free usage. For vibecoders watching their costs, it's the tool you keep bookmarked for when you've burned through other quotas or need to hammer out a lot of code without watching the meter.

**Why Antigravity matters for making money:**
- **Free heavy lifting** — Blast through implementation without cost anxiety
- **No setup friction** — Open browser, start coding
- **Quota as backup** — Keep your paid tools for complex reasoning, use Antigravity for volume

## Getting Started

1. **Sign up** at [antigravity.ai](https://antigravity.ai/)
2. **Verify email** — Standard process, no credit card required
3. **Access the workspace** — Web-based editor opens immediately
4. **Connect your repo** (optional) — GitHub/GitLab integration for context

That's it. No installation, no API keys, no configuration.

## Understanding the Free Tier

Antigravity's free quota resets periodically (typically daily). The exact limits aren't published but are generous enough for:

- Several hours of active coding per day
- Dozens of substantial code generation requests
- Full project scaffolding and implementation sessions

**Quota indicators:**
- Check your remaining quota in the dashboard
- Warnings appear as you approach limits
- Quota resets at midnight UTC (typically)

## Best Use Cases

| Task | Antigravity Fit | Why |
|------|-----------------|-----|
| Prototyping new ideas | ✅ Excellent | Iterate fast without cost concern |
| Scaffolding projects | ✅ Excellent | Generate boilerplate generously |
| Bug fixing sessions | ✅ Good | Multiple attempts don't cost extra |
| Heavy refactoring | ✅ Good | Volume work within free tier |
| Complex architecture decisions | ⚠️ Fair | Consider paid tools for nuanced reasoning |
| Production-critical code | ⚠️ Fair | May want Claude/GPT-4 for reliability |

## Quota Management Strategies

### The Rotation Strategy

Structure your day to maximize free resources:

```
Morning (fresh quotas everywhere):
└── Use Antigravity for implementation grunt work

Midday (Antigravity quota depleting):
└── Switch to AMP for continued free usage

Afternoon (both free tiers low):
└── Claude Code CLI or paid providers for remaining work
```

### The Backup Strategy

Keep Antigravity in reserve:

```
Primary: Claude Code CLI (paid, reliable)
Backup: Antigravity (when you need to preserve paid quota)
Emergency: AMP free tier (third option)
```

### The Burst Strategy

For heavy implementation days:

1. **Start with Antigravity** — Scaffold, generate, iterate
2. **Export/copy working code** — Move to your main IDE
3. **Refine with paid tools** — Use Claude for polish and edge cases

## Workflow Integration

### As Primary Agent (Budget Mode)

```
1. Open Antigravity in browser
2. Connect to your repository
3. Work until quota warning
4. Switch to backup (AMP or BYOK)
5. Return tomorrow with fresh quota
```

### As Backup Agent (Quota Preservation)

```
1. Primary work in Claude Code CLI
2. Hit a high-iteration task (generating tests, boilerplate)
3. Switch to Antigravity for the volume work
4. Return to Claude for integration/refinement
```

### Quick Access Setup

Bookmark with keyboard shortcut:
- **Chrome**: `Cmd+D`, set keyword `ag`
- **Firefox**: Bookmark, set keyword
- **Alfred/Raycast**: Create web search for instant access

## Comparison with Other Free Options

| Feature | Antigravity | AMP (Free) | Claude Free |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Daily quota | Generous | Good | Limited |
| Web-based | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Repo integration | Yes | Yes | Manual paste |
| Code execution | Yes | Yes | No |
| File editing | Yes | Yes | No |
| BYOK option | No | Yes | No |
| Best for | Volume work | Flexibility | Quick questions |

**The smart play:** Use both Antigravity and AMP. Different quota pools mean more free usage total.

## Tips for Maximizing Value

1. **Batch similar tasks** — Do all your boilerplate generation in one session
2. **Prepare context offline** — Have your requirements ready before burning quota
3. **Copy code immediately** — Don't rely on session persistence
4. **Use for exploration** — Test ideas here, implement winners elsewhere
5. **Check quota before starting** — Know what you have before committing to a session

## Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Web-only | Can't use in terminal workflows | Keep browser tab ready |
| No BYOK | Locked to their model selection | Use OpenCode for custom providers |
| Quota opacity | Hard to predict exactly when limit hits | Build in buffer time |
| Session persistence | May lose context on refresh | Save important outputs locally |
| No offline mode | Requires internet | Obviously |

## When to Use Something Else

- **Need specific model** (Claude Sonnet, GPT-4) → Use BYOK tools
- **Terminal-native workflow** → Use OpenCode or Claude Code CLI
- **Mission-critical code** → Use paid tier with best available model
- **Long-running session** → Claude Code CLI with persistent context
