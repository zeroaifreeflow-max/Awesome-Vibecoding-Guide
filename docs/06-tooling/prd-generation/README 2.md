> Planning and specification tools for structured development.

### [Clavix](clavix.md)
**CLEAR-based PRD Generator** — Transform ideas into actionable specs.

Clavix uses the CLEAR methodology to create comprehensive Product Requirements Documents:
- **C**ontext — What problem are we solving?
- **L**imitations — What constraints exist?
- **E**xpectations — What does success look like?
- **A**ctions — What needs to be built?
- **R**eview — Validation checkpoints

## Why Use PRDs?

| Without PRD | With PRD |
|-------------|----------|
| Vague requirements | Clear scope |
| Scope creep | Change control |
| Rework | Build once |
| Miscommunication | Shared understanding |

## Workflow Integration

1. **Client discovery** → Gather requirements
2. **Clavix PRD** → Generate structured spec
3. **Review with client** → Confirm scope
4. **Development** → Build against spec
5. **Delivery** → Verify against PRD

## Task List Generation

Clavix also generates task lists from PRDs:
- Break PRD into actionable tasks
- Estimate effort per task
- Track progress during development

See [Clavix documentation](clavix.md) for setup and usage.
