# Automation Offers

What you're actually selling when you sell automations.

## High-Value Automation Types

### Intake Automation
Form submission → CRM entry → Team assignment → Notification

**Sells because:** Every business has leads falling through cracks. This stops that.

### Quoting Systems
Client specs → Calculate pricing → Generate PDF → Send for approval

**Sells because:** Quoting takes hours. This makes it minutes.

### Follow-Up Sequences
Trigger event → Smart delay → Personalized reminder → Track response

**Sells because:** Following up is tedious. Most businesses don't do it consistently.

### Reporting Dashboards
Pull data → Transform → Visualize → Auto-send weekly

**Sells because:** Nobody has time to build reports manually.

### Data Processing
Messy input (emails, forms, spreadsheets) → Clean, structured output

**Sells because:** Data entry is expensive and error-prone.

## Packaging Automations

### Define Clear Inputs
- What triggers this automation?
- What data does it need?
- Where does that data come from?

### Define Clear Outputs
- What's the end result?
- Where does output go?
- What format?

### Set Boundaries
Be explicit about what's NOT included:
- "Handles standard quote requests. Custom/enterprise quotes flagged for manual review."
- "Processes up to 500 leads/month. Higher volume requires upgrade."
- "Integrates with HubSpot. Other CRMs are separate scope."

### Specify Triggers
- Manual (button click, form submission)
- Scheduled (daily, weekly, on-demand)
- Event-based (new email, webhook, status change)

## Red Flags to Avoid

- "We need AI to figure out what to do" - Too vague
- "It should handle any situation" - No edge case boundaries
- "We don't really have a process yet" - You're consulting, not automating
- "Our data is in spreadsheets everywhere" - Data cleanup project first
- "We change this all the time" - Maintenance nightmare
