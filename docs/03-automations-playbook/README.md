# AI Automations Playbook

> Build and sell AI-powered automations for clients — productized services with recurring revenue.

## What Are AI Automations?

Automations that save your clients hours of manual work:
- **Intake automation** — Forms that process, categorize, and route submissions
- **Quoting systems** — Automatic quote generation from specs
- **Follow-up sequences** — Smart email/SMS workflows
- **Reporting dashboards** — Auto-generated business reports
- **Data processing** — Transform messy inputs into structured outputs

## Why This Works

- Clients pay for **time saved**, not code written
- Recurring revenue through retainers
- Higher perceived value than websites
- Builds on vibecoding skills you already have
