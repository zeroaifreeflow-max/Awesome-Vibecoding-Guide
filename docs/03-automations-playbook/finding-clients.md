### Handling Objections

**"We can't afford automation right now"**
"I understand budget concerns. Let me show you the ROI calculation. If we can save your team 10 hours/week at $25/hour, that's $2,000/month in saved time. Our solution costs $1,500/month, so you'd have a net gain of $500/month from day one. Can I show you how this would work specifically for your business?"

**"Our processes are too unique to automate"**
"That's actually very common. Most businesses think their processes are unique, but we've found that 80% of workflows follow similar patterns. Let me ask a few questions to understand your specific process, and I can show you how we've automated similar workflows for other clients in your industry."

**"We tried automation before and it didn't work"**
"I completely understand your hesitation. Many automation tools are too rigid or require extensive technical knowledge. Our approach is different - we focus on understanding your specific workflows and building custom solutions that fit your business, not the other way around. Can I ask what didn't work in your previous attempt?"

**"Our team won't adopt new tools"**
"Change management is crucial with automation. That's why our implementation includes comprehensive training and a gradual rollout plan. We also provide ongoing support to ensure smooth adoption. Many of our clients were surprised at how quickly their teams adapted once they saw the time savings. Would it help if I shared some of their experiences?"
