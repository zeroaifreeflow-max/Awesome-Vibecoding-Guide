# Pricing Automations

How to price automation projects without leaving money on the table.

---

## The Model: Setup + Retainer

### Setup Fee
One-time payment for building the automation.

| Complexity | Price Range |
|------------|-------------|
| Simple | $500-1,000 |
| Medium | $1,000-2,000 |
| Complex | $2,000-3,000+ |

### Monthly Retainer
Ongoing fee for keeping it running.

| Automation Type | Monthly Range |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Simple | $50-100 |
| Medium | $100-200 |
| Complex | $200-300+ |

---

## Complexity Tiers

### Simple ($500-1,000)
- Single trigger
- Single action or linear sequence
- 1-2 integrations
- No decision logic
- Example: Form → Spreadsheet → Email notification

### Medium ($1,000-2,000)
- Multiple steps
- Some if/then logic
- 3-4 integrations
- Basic error handling
- Example: Lead form → CRM → Assignment logic → Personalized email sequence

### Complex ($2,000-3,000+)
- Multiple triggers
- Complex branching logic
- 5+ integrations
- AI components (classification, generation)
- Custom error handling
- Example: Multi-channel lead intake → AI scoring → Dynamic assignment → Custom quote generation → Multi-step follow-up

## What Retainer Covers

### Monitoring
- Error alerts reviewed
- Failed executions investigated
- Quick fixes applied

### Minor Adjustments
- Field mapping changes
- Small logic tweaks
- Template updates

### Monthly Check-In
- 15-30 minute call
- Review performance
- Discuss improvements

### Priority Support
- Response within 24-48 hours

## What's Extra (Not in Retainer)

- New automation workflows
- Major logic changes
- New integrations
- Platform migrations

Quote these separately.

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchor High
Start with your complex tier price. Makes medium feel reasonable.

### Price on Value, Not Time
"This saves 10 hours/week × $30/hour = $1,200/month saved."

Your $1,500 setup + $150/month is a no-brainer.

### Annual Retainer Discount
Offer 10-15% off for annual commitment. Reduces churn, improves cash flow.

## When to Charge More

- Tight deadline (rush fee: 25-50%)
- Legacy/unusual systems (complexity premium)
- High-volume processing (scale pricing)
- Compliance requirements (healthcare, finance)
- Custom integrations (no existing connector)
