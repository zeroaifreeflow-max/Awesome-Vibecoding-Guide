# Archive

> ⚠️ **This folder contains archived content** that is no longer actively maintained.

These files are kept for historical reference. They may contain outdated information about tools, providers, or approaches that have been superseded.

## Why archived?

The guide has been restructured to focus on **making money with vibecoding** rather than cataloging every available tool. Tools change weekly; business principles don't.
