# Cline / Roo Code

## Overview
Cline and Roo Code are VSCode plugins for AI-assisted coding, with Roo Code being a fork of the original Cline project. These tools bring vibecoding capabilities directly into Visual Studio Code through a GUI-based interface, making AI-assisted development accessible without leaving your familiar editor. They're commonly used across the vibecoding industry and are known for rapid development cycles with frequent updates.

## Key Strengths
- **Seamless VSCode Integration**: Work within your existing editor without switching contexts
- **GUI-Based Vibecoding**: User-friendly interface for AI interactions, perfect for developers preferring visual workflows
- **Fast Development Pace**: Both tools are actively developed with frequent updates and new features
- **Provider Integration**: Seamless integration with [GLM Coding Plan](../../ai-model-providers/glm-coding-plan.md) and [Synthetic.new](../../ai-model-providers/synthetic-new.md) subscriptions
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Access to VSCode's extensive plugin library alongside AI capabilities
- **Multiple Options**: Two actively maintained variants give users choice based on specific features or development direction

## Limitations / Current Issues
- **Unnecessary Complexity**: Add layers of abstraction that aren't needed for standard vibecoding workflows
- **Tool Call Challenges**: Experience issues with tool calls, particularly when complexity increases
- **MCP Reliability**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) calls can be problematic if the MCP server isn't super common or well-established
- **Workflow Friction**: The added complexity can slow down fast-paced vibecoding workflows rather than enhance them
- **GUI Overhead**: While the GUI is nice, it can introduce unnecessary steps compared to direct CLI interactions

## Best Use Cases
- Developers who prefer working exclusively within VSCode
- Teams already standardized on Visual Studio Code who want to add AI capabilities
- Users who value GUI-based interactions over CLI workflows
- Developers with existing GLM Coding Plan or Synthetic.new subscriptions looking for tight integration
- Projects where the VSCode extension ecosystem is critical

## Who Should Consider Alternatives
- **Fast-paced vibecoding practitioners**: The added complexity can slow down workflows that benefit from direct, streamlined interactions
- **MCP-heavy workflows**: If you rely on less common or custom MCP servers, expect reliability issues
- **CLI-first developers**: If you prefer command-line tools, the GUI overhead may feel unnecessary (consider [Kilo CLI](../recommended-tools/kilocode.md) instead)
- **Simplicity seekers**: Developers who value minimal abstraction layers between themselves and the AI

## Why I Dropped Them
I used both Cline and Roo Code for extended periods in my workflow. While they're well-crafted and popular in the vibecoding community, I ultimately moved away from them because:

1. **Complexity vs. Value**: They add architectural layers that aren't necessary for standard vibecoding. The GUI and plugin infrastructure introduce overhead without proportional benefits for my fast-paced workflow.

2. **Tool Call Reliability**: As work complexity increased, these tools struggled with consistent tool call execution, leading to frustrating debugging sessions.

3. **MCP Integration Pain**: When working with custom or less common MCP servers, the reliability dropped significantly. The tools work great with popular MCPs but struggle otherwise.

4. **Workflow Speed**: The GUI-based approach, while visually appealing, added friction to my workflow compared to direct CLI interactions.

That said, these are genuinely popular tools in the vibecoding industry for good reason—they make AI-assisted coding accessible within VSCode and have strong integration with major providers. They just didn't align with my specific workflow preferences for speed and simplicity.

## Note on Kilo Code
Kilo Code started as a fork of Cline but has since diverged significantly with the release of their CLI tool. It's now recommended as a separate tool due to its dual-platform approach (VSCode + CLI) and unique features like intelligent modes and BYOK support. See [Kilo Code](../recommended-tools/kilocode.md) in the recommended tools section.
