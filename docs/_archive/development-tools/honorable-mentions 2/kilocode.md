# Kilo Code — Versatile IDE-Native AI Assistant

## Overview

Kilo Code is a multi-platform AI coding assistant that offers both a VSCode plugin and a standalone CLI. It's particularly valuable for developers who prefer working inside an IDE with visual feedback, while still wanting access to powerful AI capabilities. The dual-approach strategy gives flexibility to choose your preferred environment without sacrificing features.

## Why Kilo Code Deserves Attention

### Best for IDE-Preferring Developers

If you prefer working inside VSCode with visual feedback, tight IDE integration, and GUI-based interactions, Kilo Code is worth serious consideration. It provides:

- **Tight IDE integration** with debugging and visual feedback
- **VSCode-native experience** without switching to terminal
- **CLI fallback** for when you need lightweight interactions
- **Seamless switching** between both interfaces

### Intelligent Modes

Kilo's different operational modes are its strongest feature. Instead of one-size-fits-all interactions, you can choose the right mode for your specific task:

- **Code Mode** (Default): General-purpose coding tasks and development with full tool access
- **Architect Mode**: Planning, technical leadership, and system design with restricted editing (markdown only)
- **Ask Mode**: Answering questions and providing information without modifying code (read-only)
- **Debug Mode**: Systematic problem diagnosis and troubleshooting with full tool access
- **Orchestrator Mode**: Strategic workflow coordination that breaks down complex tasks and delegates to specialized modes
- **Custom Modes**: Create your own specialized assistants with custom tool access and behavior

This mode flexibility means you're not wasting tokens on over-thinking simple tasks, nor are you under-resourced on complex challenges.

### Flexible Pricing Model

What sets Kilo apart is the triple offering:

- **Free Models**: Built-in access to free models without needing your own keys
- **Pay-As-You-Go via Kilo**: Use Kilo's hosted models with pay-as-you-go pricing at exact provider rates with no markup
- **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**: Connect your own API keys from any major provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.)
- **Provider Flexibility**: Easily switch between providers based on task requirements

You can start completely free to test workflows, use Kilo's pay-as-you-go service for convenience, or bring your own keys for maximum control. No vendor lock-in, no forced subscriptions.

### Universal Provider Support

Kilo supports virtually every major LLM provider:
- Anthropic (Claude)
- OpenAI (GPT models)
- Google (Gemini)
- And many more through standard API interfaces

## Best Use Cases

### Ideal For:
- **IDE-preferring developers** who want visual feedback and tight integration
- **Cost-conscious developers** looking for flexible pricing options (free → BYOK)
- **Multi-provider users** who want to switch between different LLM providers easily
- **Beginners** starting with free models and graduating to premium keys
- **VSCode users** who want AI assistance without leaving their IDE
- **Teams** needing enterprise features with centralized billing

### Especially Valuable When:
- You prefer GUI-based workflows over CLI
- You need intelligent mode selection for varying task complexity
- Budget flexibility is important (free models for learning, BYOK for production)
- You want to compare different LLM providers without tool switching

## Limitations & Considerations

### Current Constraints
- **Newer CLI**: The CLI is still relatively new compared to established tools like Claude Code or Droid
- **Documentation**: CLI documentation is evolving as the tool matures
- **VSCode Plugin History**: The plugin still shares some architectural heritage with Cline

### Not the Best Choice For:
- Developers who primarily work in terminal/CLI workflows
- Users needing extensive battle-tested documentation for every edge case
- Heavy vibecoding workflows where CLI speed matters most

## Pricing Overview

### Free Models
- Built-in access to free open-source models
- No credit card required to start
- Can run local models via Ollama and LM Studio for $0 cost

### Pay-As-You-Go via Kilo
- Access to Kilo's hosted models
- Pay exactly what the provider charges—no markup
- $20 in free credits to get started
- Simple credit system: $1 = 1 Kilo Credit

### Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)
- Connect your own API keys from any major provider
- Pay providers directly for LLM API usage
- No Kilo subscription fees
- Full control over costs and model selection

## Bottom Line

Kilo Code is a solid choice for developers who prefer IDE-native workflows with visual feedback. The intelligent modes system, flexible pricing (free/PAYG/BYOK), and dual-platform support (VSCode + CLI) make it particularly valuable for:

- VSCode users who want AI assistance without terminal switching
- Developers testing different providers and models
- Teams needing enterprise features with centralized management

If you're primarily a CLI user or heavy into vibecoding workflows, [Claude Code CLI](../recommended-tools/claude-code-cli.md) or [Droid CLI](../recommended-tools/droid-cli.md) might be better fits. But for IDE-centric development, Kilo deserves serious consideration.
