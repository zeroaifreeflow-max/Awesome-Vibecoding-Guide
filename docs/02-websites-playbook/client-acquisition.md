# Client Acquisition: Finding and Closing Local Business Clients

This guide covers the complete process of finding, approaching, and closing clients for your website business. Based on real commercial experience building sites for plumbers, electricians, barbers, and similar local businesses.

---

## Finding Clients

### Google Maps Prospecting

The most reliable method for finding businesses without websites.

**Process:**

1. Open Google Maps
2. Search: "[service] near [location]" (e.g., "plumber near Austin")
3. Click each business listing
4. Check if they have a website listed
5. If no website OR the website looks terrible → potential client

**What to look for:**
- No website at all (best leads)
- Outdated websites (built 5+ years ago)
- Sites that fail mobile test
- Slow-loading WordPress sites
- Sites with broken contact forms

**Organize your leads:**
```
Business Name | Phone | Email | Notes
Johnson Plumbing | 555-1234 | - | No website
Mike's Electric | 555-5678 | mike@... | WordPress, very slow
City Barbers | 555-9012 | - | Website from 2015
```

### Cold Outreach

Cold email has very low conversion (0.05% in experience), but cold calling and in-person visits work better.

**Cold Email Script (for reference):**

```
Subject: Quick question about [Business Name]'s online presence

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Business Name] doesn't have a website (or has one that 
could use an update). I help local [plumbers/electricians/etc.] 
in [city] get more calls through fast, mobile-friendly websites.

My sites:
- Load in under 1 second (customers hate waiting)
- Work perfectly on phones
- Cost $0/month to host
- Are built in 48-72 hours

Would a 10-minute call this week make sense?

[Your name]
[Your portfolio URL]
```

**Cold Call Script:**

```
"Hi, is this [Owner name]? My name is [Your name], I build websites 
for local businesses in [city]. I noticed [Business Name] doesn't 
have a website and wanted to ask—are you getting enough calls right 
now, or is that something you'd like more of?

[If yes to more calls]

Great. I specialize in fast websites that show up on Google. Most 
of my clients are [plumbers/electricians/similar trades]. I can 
have a professional site live for you in 2 days for [$X]. 

Would you have 10 minutes this week to chat about it?"
```

**In-Person Visit (Best Conversion):**

1. Walk in during slow hours
2. Ask to speak with the owner
3. Introduce yourself briefly
4. Leave a business card with your portfolio URL
5. Follow up via phone/email within 48 hours

### Existing Clients & Referrals

Your best source of new clients after the first 3-6 months.

**Why referrals work:**
- Pre-qualified (someone they trust recommended you)
- Shorter sales cycle
- Usually same industry (you already know the niche)
- Higher close rate (50%+ vs. 5% for cold)

**When to ask for referrals:**
- Immediately after launch (client is excited)
- 30 days post-launch (they've seen results)
- When they compliment your work

**How to ask:**

```
"I'm glad you're happy with the site! Quick question—do you know 
any other [plumbers/electricians/business owners] who might need 
a website? I'd appreciate any introductions."
```

---

### Local Networking

Build relationships in your business community.

**Where to network:**
- Chamber of Commerce events
- BNI or similar networking groups
- Trade association meetings
- Local business Facebook groups
- Industry-specific online communities

**Your pitch at networking events:**

```
"I build websites for local service businesses—plumbers, 
electricians, contractors. My sites load fast, work great on 
mobile, and help businesses show up on Google. I can usually 
have a site live in 48 hours."
```

**Follow-up strategy:**
- Connect on LinkedIn within 24 hours
- Send a brief email: "Great meeting you at [event]"
- Offer to review their current website (free value)

---

### Building Social Proof

You need proof before you have clients. Here's how.

**Building initial portfolio:**
1. Build your own portfolio site (required)
2. Offer 1-2 free/discounted sites to friends/family businesses
3. Create demo sites for fictional businesses in target niches
4. Document before/after for redesigns

**Collecting testimonials:**
- Ask immediately after launch
- Provide a template to make it easy
- Get permission to use their name and business

**Testimonial request:**

```
"Could you write a quick sentence or two about your experience 
working with me? Something like:

- What was the process like?
- How's the site performing?
- Would you recommend me?

I'll feature it on my portfolio with your business name."
```

---

## Closing Clients

### Initial Consultation Script

**Opening (2 min):**
```
"Thanks for taking the time. I looked at your current situation 
before this call. Can you tell me a bit about your business and 
what you're hoping to accomplish with a website?"
```

**Discovery (5 min):**
- What services do you offer?
- Who's your typical customer?
- How do people find you now?
- Have you had a website before?
- What's your timeline?

**Your pitch (3 min):**
```
"Based on what you've told me, here's what I'd recommend:

A [3-5 page] site with your services, contact info, and a gallery 
of your work. It'll load fast, look great on phones, and help you 
show up on Google.

I can have it live in [48-72 hours]. The cost is [$X] one-time, 
and hosting is free—no monthly fees.

What questions do you have?"
```

---

### Handling Objections

**"I don't need a website"**

```
"Fair enough. Are you fully booked for the next 3 months? [If yes] 
A website builds your portfolio so when things slow down—and they 
always do seasonally—you have customers finding you. Think of it 
as insurance for slower months."
```

**"WordPress is fine"**

```
"WordPress works for some businesses. The challenge is maintenance—
updates, security patches, plugin conflicts. My sites are static, 
which means no updates, no security issues, no monthly hosting fees. 
And they load 3-4x faster, which Google loves. Want me to run a 
speed test on your current site?"
```

**"That's too expensive"**

```
"I understand. What were you hoping to pay? [Listen] Here's the 
thing—a website that gets you one extra job pays for itself. If 
you charge [$X per job], the site pays for itself with a single 
customer. How many jobs does your average customer represent over 
their lifetime?"
```

**"I'll think about it"**

```
"Of course. What specifically do you want to think about—the price, 
the timeline, or something else? [Address specific concern] I have 
openings this week and next week is getting busy. If you want to 
move forward, I'd need a decision by [date]."
```

**"Can you do it cheaper?"**

```
"My prices reflect the quality and speed I deliver. What I can do 
is adjust the scope—fewer pages, simpler design—if budget is tight. 
What's your absolute max budget?"
```

```

- Downtown Barbers (link) - 3 pages, 99 Lighthouse score
```

**Show performance metrics:**
- Google PageSpeed score

### Contract Essentials

**What your contract must include:**

1. **Scope of work** - Exact pages and features
2. **Timeline** - Start date, delivery date
3. **Price** - Total cost, payment schedule
4. **What client provides** - Content, images, logo
5. **Revision policy** - How many rounds included
6. **Ownership** - Client owns the final site
7. **Hosting details** - Where it's hosted, who controls it

**Payment structure:**
```
Option A: 50% upfront, 50% on completion
Option B: 100% upfront (offer 10% discount)
```

**Keep it simple.** A 1-page agreement signed via email is fine for projects under $1,000.

## Referral System

### When to Ask

**Best moments:**
1. Right after launch ("Great, the site is live!")
2. When they say something positive ("Glad you're happy—who else should I talk to?")
3. 30-day follow-up ("How's the site performing? Know anyone who needs one?")

### Referral Incentives

**Options that work:**
- $50 credit toward future work
- Free minor update (add a page, refresh photos)
- Cash bonus ($50-100 for each referral that converts)

**Incentive script:**

```
"If you refer someone who becomes a client, I'll give you [$50 
credit / a free update / $50 cash]. Just have them mention your 
name when they reach out."
```

### Testimonial Collection

**Request template:**

```
Subject: Quick favor - testimonial for my site?

Hi [Name],

Now that your site has been live for a few weeks, I'd love a quick 
testimonial for my portfolio. Just 2-3 sentences is perfect.

Something like:
"[Your Name] built our website in [X days]. It looks great, loads 
fast, and we've already gotten [result]. Would recommend."

Can I feature it with your name and business?

Thanks!
[Your name]
```

**Follow up once** if they don't respond. Don't push harder.
