# The Business Model: Local Business Websites

## Core Business Model

**What:** Build simple, modern websites for local service businesses
**Who:** Plumbers, electricians, barbers, cleaners, contractors, etc.
**How:** Astro + Tailwind + Cloudflare Pages
**Price:** $300-700 per website (sometimes more)
**Time:** 4-6 hours per typical website

## My Day-to-Day Reality

Beyond my 9-5 corporate work, I build websites for local businesses. It's not glamorous, it's not viral, it's not going to be featured on Product Hunt.

**But it works.**

## What Success Looks Like

### Income Breakdown
- **2 websites/month** = ~$1,000
- In my European country:
  - $300 covers rent + household costs (excl. food)
  - $1,000 covers my family of 4 including most food

Your numbers will vary based on:
- Your country and cost of living
- Your proficiency with the tech stack
- Your local market and pricing power
- How you acquire clients

## Typical Website Structure

### Standard Single-Page Site (4-6 hours)
For an electrical service company, for example:

1. **Hero Section** - Company name, tagline, CTA
2. **Services** - What they offer
3. **Pricing** - Clear pricing or request quote
4. **Portfolio** - Photos of completed work
5. **Contact Form** - Lead generation
6. **Map & Contact Info** - Address, phone, email
7. **Privacy Policy Page** - Legal requirements

**Tech Stack:**
- Astro for static site generation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Cloudflare Pages for free hosting
- Contact form (Cloudflare Workers or external service)

## Why This Model Works

### 1. Differentiates from WordPress

Most small businesses get sold WordPress because it was the only affordable option. But they don't need:
- A complex CMS
- Dozens of plugins
- Database overhead
- Security vulnerabilities
- Slow loading times

They need a fast, professional website that works.

### 2. Free Hosting = Competitive Advantage

**Traditional model:**
- Website: $500
- Hosting + Maintenance: $10-50/month ongoing
- Total Year 1: $500 + ($25 × 12) = $800

**Your model:**
- Website: $600-1,000
- Hosting: $0 (Cloudflare Pages)
- Maintenance: Included for 30-60 days, then tiny changes free
- Total Year 1: $600-1,000
- **Year 2+:** $0 (maybe $10-50 for big changes)

The website pays for itself within a year just on hosting savings.

### 3. Smart Service Structure

**Grace Period:** 30-60 days of free changes after launch
- Catch any issues
- Build client trust
- Fine-tune content

**After Grace Period:**
- Tiny changes: Free (builds goodwill, takes 5 minutes)
- Big changes: Separately billed
- Maintenance: Not needed with static sites

**Smart Solutions:**
- Complex pricing? Attach a downloadable PDF, replace link once/year
- Menu changes? PDF or simple page update
- New services? Quick content update

Most clients don't need constant changes. If they do, charge accordingly.

## Proficiency is Key

Your first website might take 12-20 hours. That's normal.

As you get proficient:
- Reuse components across projects
- Build a starter template
- Standardize your workflow
- Know your tech stack inside-out

By website 10, you'll be consistently hitting 4-6 hours for standard sites.

## Not Infinitely Scalable, But That's OK

This model isn't VC-scalable. You can't 10x overnight.

**But you can:**
- Increase prices as you get better
- Build a portfolio and reputation
- Get referrals from happy clients
- Specialize in specific industries
- Eventually hire or partner with others

## Different from SaaS

### SaaS Model:
- Build once, sell many times
- Recurring revenue
- High risk, high reward
- Requires user acquisition
- Needs ongoing development
- Most fail completely

### Local Business Model:
- Build many times, sell each once
- One-time payment
- Low risk, steady reward
- Direct B2B sales
- Minimal ongoing work
- Consistent success rate

## Required Skills

### Technical:
- HTML/CSS basics (Tailwind makes this easier)
- Astro framework
- Git basics
- Cloudflare Pages deployment
- Basic forms/APIs

### Business:
- Finding clients (covered in Getting Started guide)
- Pricing conversations
- Managing client expectations
- Basic project management
- Communication skills

### Vibecoding:
- Effective prompting
- Context management
- Debugging AI output
- Knowing when to code manually vs AI

## Real Example Timeline

**Day 1-2: Discovery & Planning (1-2 hours)**
- Client consultation
- Gather content (text, images, logos)
- Agree on structure and design direction

**Day 3: Development (4-6 hours)**
- Set up Astro project
- Build pages with AI assistance
- Style with Tailwind
- Implement contact form
- Test on mobile/desktop

**Day 4: Review & Revisions (1-2 hours)**
- Client reviews
- Make changes
- Final testing

**Day 5: Deploy (30 minutes)**
- Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
- Set up custom domain
- Final client walkthrough

**Total:** 7-10 hours including client communication

You're billing $300-700 for this work = $30-100/hour effective rate.

## Scalability Considerations

- Focus on quality

- Specialize if desired
- Build referral network

**Mature Stage (20+ websites):**

## Income Scenarios

- $400 per site
- 6 hours per site
- Tool costs: $50/month
- **Net: $350/month** (~$4,200/year)

### Realistic (2 websites/month):
- $500 per site
- 5 hours per site
- Tool costs: $75/month

### Professional (6 websites/month):
- $700 per site
- 4 hours per site
- Tool costs: $150/month
- **Net: $4,050/month** (~$48,600/year)

These are side-income numbers. Not life-changing, but substantial and sustainable.
