# Business Model: Building Websites for Local Businesses

## Overview

This section documents a proven, practical business model for making money with vibecoding - not by building the next SaaS unicorn, but by solving real problems for real businesses.

**The Core Concept:** Build simple, fast, modern websites for local businesses (plumbers, electricians, barbers, etc.) using Astro + Tailwind, hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

## Why This Works

Unlike the common narrative of "build a SaaS and get rich with vibecoding," this model:
- ✅ Solves actual problems for paying customers
- ✅ Generates income from day one
- ✅ Requires no ongoing hosting costs (free Cloudflare Pages)
- ✅ Differentiates from the sea of WordPress sites
- ✅ Is sustainable and scalable based on your proficiency

- **Price Range**: $300-700+ (minimum $300)
- **Income Goal**: ~$1000/month = 2 websites
- **Tech Stack**: Astro + Tailwind + Cloudflare Pages (free hosting)
- **Target Clients**: Local service businesses

## Philosophy

Most small businesses don't need WordPress. They don't need complex CMSs, plugins, and expensive hosting. They need:
- A fast, professional website that loads instantly
- Clear information about their services
- Contact forms that work
- Mobile-friendly design
- No ongoing hosting fees eating into their budget

This is what vibecoding excels at - building exactly what's needed, nothing more, nothing less.
