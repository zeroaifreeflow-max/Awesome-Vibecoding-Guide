## After the Sale

### Timing Matters
- **Don't** pitch retainers during initial proposal
- **Do** mention them after successful launch
- Best timing: 1-2 weeks post-launch when they're happy

### How to Propose
> "Your site's live and looking great. Most clients find it helpful to have ongoing support for updates and security. I offer a simple maintenance plan starting at $25/month—want me to send details?"

Keep it casual. No pressure.

### Managing Ongoing Relationships
- Set clear boundaries on response times
- Document everything in a shared doc
- Monthly check-in email (even if nothing changed)
- Track time spent per client

## Caution: The High-Touch Client

Some clients need constant changes. Red flags:
- Weekly "quick" requests
- Scope creep on every task
- Can't decide, keeps revising

**Solution:** They need a CMS, not a static site with retainer.

Propose a WordPress/Webflow migration. Either they pay for the upgrade or you part ways professionally.

Retainers should be low-touch passive income, not a second job.

## Quick Math

10 retainer clients × $35/month average = $350/month recurring

That's $4,200/year for ~10 hours of work total.

Build the base. Let it compound.
