# Scaling Your Website Business

Going from 2 to 10 sites per month. What changes, what breaks, what matters.

---

## Systems for Scale

You can't scale chaos. Build these first.

### Template Library
Create reusable starting points:
- **Hero sections** (3-4 variants)
- **Services layouts** (grid, list, cards)
- **Contact sections** (form, map, info)
- **Testimonial blocks** (slider, grid, single)
- **Footer variants** (simple, detailed, multi-column)

Time saved per project: 2-4 hours

### Standardized Workflow
Document your process:
1. Discovery call (15 min max)
2. Proposal sent (same day)
3. Deposit received → project starts
4. Content intake form sent
5. First draft (3-5 days)
6. Revision round (1-2 max)
7. Launch + handoff
8. Retainer pitch (1 week post-launch)

### Content Intake Forms
Stop chasing content. Create a form that collects:
- Business name, tagline, description
- Services/products list
- Contact info
- Social links
- Logo + brand colors
- Photos (or permission to use stock)
- Competitor sites they like

Use Tally, Typeform, or Google Forms. Send immediately after deposit.

### Automated Deployment
- GitHub → Vercel/Netlify auto-deploy
- Domain connection templated
- SSL automatic
- No manual FTP ever

## Time Optimization

### What Actually Takes Time
| Task | Time | Controllable? |
|------|------|---------------|
| Waiting for content | 3-7 days | Partially |
| Revision cycles | 2-5 hours | Yes |
| Client communication | 1-2 hours | Yes |
| Actual building | 3-6 hours | Yes |

Content waiting is the bottleneck. Attack it first.

### Batch Similar Tasks
Monday: All discovery calls
Tuesday-Thursday: Build time (no calls)
Friday: Revisions + launches

Context switching kills productivity.

### Reducing Revision Cycles
- Show wireframe/mockup before building
- Limit to 2 revision rounds in contract
- "Final review" framing on last round
- Charge for additional rounds ($50/round)

---

## Pricing for Scale

### When to Raise Prices
- Fully booked for 2+ months
- Turning away work
- Every 5-10 completed projects
- When you dread saying yes at current rate

### Two Strategies

**Premium Path:**
- Fewer clients, higher prices
- $800-1500 per site
- 4-6 sites/month
- More selective, better clients

**Volume Path:**
- More clients, moderate prices
- $400-600 per site
- 8-12 sites/month
- Tighter systems required

Pick one. Straddling both burns you out.

### Selective Client Acceptance
Say no to:
- "Can you match this cheaper quote?"
- Unclear on what they want
- No budget, just "exploring"
- Need it yesterday

Say yes to:
- Clear requirements
- Responsive communication
- Pays deposit quickly
- Referred by good client

## Team Options

### Working Solo
**Realistic capacity:** 4-6 sites/month

Beyond that, quality drops or you burn out.

### Partner Model
Split work with another dev:
- You do sales + design
- They do builds
- 50/50 or 60/40 split

Works if you trust them completely.

### Subcontracting Tasks
Outsource specific pieces:
- Content writing ($50-100/page)
- Stock photo selection ($20-30/site)
- Basic SEO setup ($30-50/site)

Keep design and client contact in-house.

### When to Grow vs Stay Lean
**Grow if:**
- Turning away $5k+/month in work
- Want to build an agency
- Have reliable talent pool

**Stay lean if:**
- Value flexibility over revenue
- Clients hire you specifically
- Don't want management overhead

## Warning Signs

### Burnout Indicators
- Dreading new projects
- Missing deadlines
- Cutting corners on quality
- Working weekends consistently
- Snapping at clients

### Quality Slipping
- More revision requests than usual
- Clients less enthusiastic at launch
- You're not proud of the work

### When to Slow Down
- Raise prices 25%
- Stop marketing for 2-4 weeks
- Finish backlog before new intake
- Take a week off (seriously)

Sustainable beats maximum every time.

## Realistic Scaling Timeline

| Month | Sites | Revenue | Status |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| 1-2 | 2-3 | $1,000-1,500 | Learning |
| 3-4 | 3-4 | $1,500-2,500 | Finding rhythm |
| 5-6 | 4-6 | $2,500-4,000 | Systems working |
| 7-12 | 5-8 | $3,500-6,000 | Sustainable pace |

Rushing past this timeline = burnout.

Build slow, build solid.
