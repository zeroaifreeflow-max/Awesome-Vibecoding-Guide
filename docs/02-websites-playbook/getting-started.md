## Prerequisites: Before You Start

### Your Portfolio Website is CRITICAL

**This is the most important point in this entire guide:**

You MUST have your own portfolio website done and totally polished before trying to sell website services.

**Why this matters:**
- If you can't set up your own business website, how would you do it for others?
- Many people promote services on Facebook without adding a portfolio link - huge mistake
- Your website is your demo, your proof, your credibility

**What your portfolio needs:**
- ✅ About me section
- ✅ Projects you've realized (even if practice projects initially)
- ✅ Pricing structure
- ✅ Your offer - what makes you different from WordPress
- ✅ Contact information
- ✅ **Perfect optimization** - mobile responsive, fast, great Core Web Vitals
- ✅ Google Business Profile set up
- ✅ Google Search Console configured
- ✅ Sitemap submitted

**Position your offer prominently** - put what makes your offering outstanding close to the hero banner to ensure people actually read it.

**Bonus:** Building your portfolio website teaches you all the tools you'll need for client work: Git, GitHub, Cloudflare deployment, Google Search Console, sitemaps, SEO metadata, business JSON-LD data, etc.

### Essential Skills You Need

**Technical (can be learned while building portfolio):**
- Git and GitHub basics
- How to connect GitHub to Cloudflare Pages and deploy
- Google Search Console
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- SEO basics (meta tags, JSON-LD business data, sitemaps)
- Astro framework fundamentals
- Tailwind CSS basics
- Form handling solutions

**Business:**
- Basic communication skills
- Ability to understand client needs
- Setting and managing expectations
- Basic project scoping

**Don't overspend before making money:**

The MAIN MISTAKE beginners make is overspending on tools and services before making any money.

❌ **DON'T:** Pay $200/month for Claude Pro before you have clients
✅ **DO:** Use affordable AI providers until you're profitable

**Smart tool choices for starting out:**
- [SyntheticNew](../../docs/preparation/synthetic-new.md) - Affordable LLM provider for vibecoding
- [Droid CLI](../../docs/preparation/droid.md) - Cost-effective coding agent
- Budget tools that are capable, not premium subscriptions

**The philosophy:** Don't invest heavily in tools until you're proficient AND making money. The more you spend on tools, the more it cuts into your profit margin.

### Minimum Skill Level to Start Charging

You need to be able to:
- Develop a "good" website that's optimized for mobile, desktop, and performance
- Deploy it successfully
- Handle basic troubleshooting

**How to get there:**
- Build your portfolio website (this teaches you everything)
- Use AI chats to guide you through the process
- Read this guide fully
- Maybe build 1-2 practice websites to get comfortable

## Finding Your First Clients

### What Actually Works

#### 1. Facebook Marketing (Primary Strategy)

**Two approaches:**
- Posts on your business fanpage
- Posts in local small business groups
- Personal network - talk to friends and promote your services

**Why it works:**
- Direct access to local business owners
- Community-based trust
- Low cost (just time)
- Can target specific geographic areas

#### 2. Direct Local Outreach

**The underrated strategy:** Just go talk to businesses.

- See a barber shop? Walk in and talk to the owner
- Electrician? Stop by their office
- Local restaurant? Chat with the manager

**Works for:**
- Businesses within your geographic area
- Service businesses (plumbers, electricians, contractors)
- Retail and hospitality (barbers, cafes, small shops)

**Scope:** Start locally, expand nationally

The real-world example: Operating nationwide but willing to work internationally. With local businesses, physical proximity can be an advantage for that personal connection.

### What DOESN'T Work (Save Your Time)

#### Cold Email Campaigns ❌

**Reality check:** Over 2,000 emails sent = ONE response.

That's a 0.05% response rate. Your time is better spent elsewhere.

### Identifying the Right Clients

**Critical insight:** Not all businesses NEED a website, but they might WANT one.

#### Understanding Pain Points

**Wrong approach:**
"You need a website to get more clients!"

**Problem:** If a business is fully booked for the next 3 months, they don't need more clients right now.

**Right approach:**
"A website lets you build your portfolio and stay recognizable during slower months, so you have clients year-round."

**Fit your solution to their actual pain point:**
- Busy now → Focus on long-term visibility and branding
- Slow now → Focus on immediate lead generation
- New business → Focus on credibility and professional presence
- Established business → Focus on modernization and staying competitive

#### Where to Look

**Businesses that often need websites:**
- Local service providers (plumbers, electricians, HVAC)
- Home improvement contractors
- Personal services (barbers, salons, cleaning)
- Small retail shops
- Restaurants and cafes
- Professional services (accountants, consultants)

**Red flags to avoid:**
- Wants a fully editable CMS (that's WordPress territory)
- Wants "too much for too low price"
- Unrealistic expectations about instant results

---

## Marketing That Actually Works

### Phase 1: Active Marketing (First 3-6 Months)

**Time investment:** 30-50% marketing, 50-70% building websites

This phase requires significant marketing effort, but it pays off.

**Focus areas:**
1. Facebook presence and local groups
2. Personal network outreach
3. Local business visits
4. Building your portfolio with real projects

### Phase 2: Referral-Based Growth (After 6+ Months)

**What changes:**
- Initial clients start recommending your services
- Word-of-mouth becomes primary channel
- Marketing effort drops significantly
- You may become fully booked without active marketing

**Real example:** After months of active marketing, currently fully booked with zero marketing effort - everything comes from client recommendations.

### Your Portfolio Website as Marketing

Your website does the selling for you:

**Must-have elements:**
- Live examples of your work
- Before/after comparisons (if available)
- Speed and performance metrics
- Client testimonials (once you have them)
- Clear pricing or pricing structure
- Contact form that actually works

**Demo strategy:** Use Cloudflare Pages .pages.dev URLs to show clients "first version" mockups before final deployment.

### The SEO & Performance Selling Point

**This is your strongest differentiator:**

> "Coded websites rank better in Google than WordPress sites."

**Why this matters:**
- Google now values Core Web Vitals scores higher than ever
- Mobile-first approach is critical
- Performance matters more than a bunch of SEO articles
- If you set up all SEO correctly (meta data, JSON business data), websites rank organically without expensive SEO campaigns

**Your advantage:**
- WordPress = plugins, slow loading, database overhead
- Your sites = fast, clean, optimized, modern

### Long-Term Cost Pitch

**Traditional model:**
- Website: $500
- Hosting: $10-50/month ongoing
- Year 1 total: $800+
- Year 2+: $120-600/year just for hosting

**Your model:**
- Website: $600-1,000
- Hosting: $0 (Cloudflare Pages)
- Year 2+: $0 (or $10-50 for occasional big changes)

**The pitch:** "The website pays for itself within a year just on hosting savings."

## The Sales Process

### Initial Client Conversation

**Key questions to ask:**
1. What kind of clients do they have?
2. What's their main service they want to promote?
3. What's their current situation? (no site, old site, WordPress, etc.)
4. What's their pain point? (not enough clients, looking unprofessional, slow season planning, etc.)

**This is usually enough to decide if the project is a fit.**

### Design & Style Discovery

**Follow-up questions:**
- Any styles they like or want to be connected to?
- Websites they like the look of?
- Colors, branding elements they want to include?
- Do they have a logo?

**Goal:** Create something your client will like visually while maintaining quality standards.

### Pricing Conversation

**Strategy:** Custom quote or fixed price per website, depending on size.

**Typical pricing (in context where minimum salary is ~$1,000):**
- **Small site** (4 sections: hero, offer, contact form, map): $200-300
  - Example: 2 hours total with deployment
- **Standard site** (full landing page, 6-8 sections): $300-700
  - Example: 4-6 hours of work
- **Large site** (12-15 subpages, lots of content): $2,000+
  - Example: Complex projects with extensive content

**Adjust for your market** - these prices work in a European country with $1k minimum wage. Scale accordingly for your region.

**Pricing by value, not just hours:**
- A 2-hour simple site for an electrician: $200-300
- A 6-hour comprehensive site for a contractor: $600-700
- A 15-subpage site with complex content: $2,000+

### Handling Common Objections

#### "WordPress is cheaper"

**Response:**
"WordPress might be cheaper upfront, but comes with:
- Plugins that slow down the website
- Need for separate server hosting ($10-50/month ongoing)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Maintenance requirements

**Better question:** Even if it's cheaper, will it make sales for you?

If they have a WordPress site and aren't seeing results, you can solve that with a better-performing website that ranks higher in Google."

#### "My nephew/friend can do it cheaper"

**Response:**
"That's great! If they can build you a fast, modern, SEO-optimized site that ranks well in Google, that's a good option.

What I offer is professional quality with modern performance that WordPress can't match, plus all the Google optimization already built in. The performance difference directly impacts how Google ranks you."

#### "I need to think about it"

**Response:**
"Of course! Take your time. Here's my portfolio [link] if you want to see examples of my work and the performance metrics.

Feel free to reach out when you're ready, or if you have any questions."

**Accept that some leads won't convert** - this is normal and requires experience.

### Contracts & Agreements

**Legal structure (varies by country):**
- Everything written over email (legally sufficient in some countries)
- No formal contract required (check your local laws)
- Agreed to be paid via invoice sent after website is completed

**⚠️ Important:** Review your country's laws on contracts, deposits, and business agreements. What works in one country may not work in another.

### Payment Terms

**Standard approach:** No deposit, payment after delivery

**Why this works:**
1. **For clients:**
   - Don't pay until they see results
   - Feels safer and builds trust
   - Shows your confidence in your work

2. **For you:**
   - No deposit refund complications
   - Simpler legally
   - Client is motivated to provide content/feedback quickly

**Exception:** Larger projects ($1,000+) may warrant a deposit to cover initial time investment.

### Payment Security

**What if a client doesn't pay?**

Built-in leverage:
- Website is on your Cloudflare account
- You can turn it off or add a "payment pending" banner
- Mention this reality between the lines during agreement (don't be explicit or threatening)

**Reality check:** Haven't had a client not pay yet, but play it safely.

**Be reasonable:**
- Don't turn off a site if they're a day late
- Communication and professionalism go a long way
- Most clients pay promptly when they see good work

---

## Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Content Gathering (Before You Code)

**Method:** Email-based process

**What to ask for:**
- Services descriptions
- Pricing information
- Any existing text content
- Logo and images
- Contact information
- Any specific requirements

**Tools:**
- Email exchange
- Google Docs/Presentations
- Shared folders for images

**What you can offer:**
- "I can help write optimized content for SEO if you don't have everything"
- "You provide the services and pricing, I'll handle the rest"

**Client must provide:**
- Services descriptions
- Pricing structure
- Their core business information

### Step 2: Development (4-6 hours typical)

**Process:**
1. Set up Astro project
2. Build pages with vibecoding assistance
3. Style with Tailwind
4. Implement contact form (e.g., Formspark)
5. Add SEO metadata and JSON-LD business data
6. Test on mobile and desktop
7. Check performance (Google PageSpeed Insights)

**Deploy first version:**
- Push to GitHub
- Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (.pages.dev URL)
- Send preview link to client for feedback

### Step 3: Client Review & Revisions (1-2 hours)

**Process:**
- Client reviews the .pages.dev preview
- Gather feedback on what to change
- Make revisions
- Final testing

**Manage expectations:**
- Some back-and-forth is normal
- Major scope changes should be discussed (may affect price)
- Keep communication professional and responsive

### Step 4: Domain & Deployment (30 minutes)

**Domain options:**
1. Client already has domain
   - Add DNS records to point to Cloudflare
2. Client needs domain
   - Register through Cloudflare (cheap and easy)
   - Include in your service offering

**Final deployment:**
- Set up custom domain in Cloudflare Pages
- Verify DNS propagation
- Final testing on live domain
- Submit sitemap to Google Search Console

### Step 5: Invoice & Payment

**After deployment:**
- Send invoice via email
- Include payment details
- Professional format

**Timeline:**
- Most clients pay within days of invoice
- Be patient but follow up if needed

### Step 6: Post-Launch Support

**Grace period:** 30-60 days of free changes

**What this covers:**
- Bug fixes
- Minor content tweaks
- Fine-tuning
- Any issues that arise

**After grace period:**
- Tiny changes: Free (builds goodwill, takes 5 minutes)
- Big changes: Separately billed
- Maintenance: Not needed with static sites

**Smart solutions for ongoing changes:**
- Complex pricing → PDF download, update link once/year
- Menu changes → PDF or simple page update
- New services → Quick content update, bill accordingly

**Reality:** Most clients don't need constant changes. If they do, charge accordingly.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Underpricing Before Requirements Are Clear ⚠️

**Real mistake:** Quoted $400 before collecting all requirements, ended up with 12 subpages.

**Lesson:** Always gather full requirements before giving a price.

**How to avoid:**
- Ask about number of pages/sections
- Understand content scope
- Clarify any special features
- Give a range, then finalize after discovery

### 2. Overspending on Tools Too Early 💸

**The trap:** Spending $200/month on Claude Pro + premium tools before making any money.

**The reality:** Premium tools don't make you money - clients do.

**Smart approach:**
- Start with affordable tools ([SyntheticNew](../../docs/preparation/synthetic-new.md), [Droid CLI](../../docs/preparation/droid.md))
- Upgrade only when profitable
- Every dollar spent on tools reduces your profit margin
- You don't need premium everything to deliver quality

### 3. Accepting the Wrong Clients

**Red flags:**
- Wants fully editable website on their end → This is WordPress territory
- Wants too much for too low price → Recipe for frustration
- Unrealistic expectations → Will never be satisfied

**Solution:** It's okay to say no or refer them to WordPress developers.

**Alternative for light editing needs:**
- Astro + Keystatic CMS for blog pages
- Give them limited, safe editing capability

### 4. Not Having Your Portfolio Ready

**The mistake:** Marketing services without a portfolio website.

**Why it fails:** Clients can't see your work or trust your capabilities.

**Solution:** Portfolio first, marketing second.

### 5. Over-Promising & Under-Delivering

**Common trap:** "I can do anything!" → Then struggle to deliver.

**Better approach:**
- Be honest about what you can do well
- Set realistic timelines
- Under-promise, over-deliver

## What to Expect vs What NOT to Expect

### ✅ What This Business IS

**Sustainable side income:**
- 2-3 websites/month = covers rent + food for family of 4
- 6-7 websites/month = close to full-time corporate salary
- Achievable with 5-7 hours/day of work
- Can grow to $1,000-4,000+/month

**Skills-based earnings:**
- You get faster over time
- Can raise prices as you improve
- Build valuable portfolio
- Learn in-demand technical skills

**Flexible work:**
- Work around your schedule
- Choose your clients
- Set your own pace
- Location independent (mostly)

**Real business:**
- Actual paying clients
- Solves real problems
- Recurring through referrals
- Sustainable long-term

### ❌ What This Business ISN'T

**Not infinitely scalable:**
- Can't 10x overnight like SaaS
- Limited by your time and effort
- Not VC-scalable or "explosive growth"

**Not passive income:**
- Each website requires work
- Client communication needed
- Active marketing (at least initially)
- Not "make money while you sleep"

**Not get-rich-quick:**
- Takes time to build up
- Requires learning and skill
- First clients take longest
- Success requires consistency

**Not fully automated:**
- Clients need human interaction
- Custom work for each project
- Can't just set and forget

**Not for everyone:**
- Requires sales/marketing effort
- Need to handle client relationships
- Technical skills required
- Self-motivation essential

### Real Success Looks Like

**Modest example:**
- 2 websites/month
- $500 per website
- $1,000/month side income
- 10-12 hours/month work

**Ambitious example:**
- 4-6 websites/month
- $600-700 per website
- $2,400-4,200/month
- 20-30 hours/month work

**Note:** These are side-income numbers that won't necessarily replace a well-paying day job (especially if you're in top income brackets), but they can significantly supplement income or cover major expenses.

---

## The Hardest Part (Real Talk)

### Finding the Balance

**The challenge:** Balancing investment vs returns.

- Spending $200/month on tools won't make you money immediately
- This business is about knowing what needs to be done and bringing clients
- Once proficient, you'll realize you don't need to spend much to be profitable

**Key insight:** The more you spend on tools, the more it cuts into profit margin.

### Finding Clients (Early Stage)

After you've built 3-5 websites and know your stack:

**Finding clients is the most tedious part** when you don't have referrals yet.

**The reality:**
- Requires significant effort
- Success can't be guaranteed
- Seasonal variations (some weeks = 1 tiny project, other weeks = fully booked)

**The good news:**
- Gets much easier after 6+ months
- Referrals become primary source
- Can get fully booked without marketing

### Dealing with Uncertainty

**Week-to-week variation:**
- Some weeks: Single client for tiny website
- Other weeks: Fully booked, no marketing needed
- Depends on season, market, luck

**Mindset required:**
- Be brave and persistent
- Don't give up during slow periods
- Keep marketing consistently at first
- Trust the process

**Quote from experience:** "Just be brave and move on."
