# The Reality Check: Making Money with Vibecoding

## The Hype vs. Reality

Everyone wants to sell you the dream: "Vibecoding is the easiest way to make money!" They position it the same way they did with dropshipping years ago - quick riches, minimal effort, passive income.

**Here's the truth:** Maybe 5% (or even <1%) of vibecoders will make any actual profit from vibecoding.

## What "Profit" Really Means

When we say profit, we mean:
- Money received for work
- **MINUS** tool subscriptions (AI providers, development tools)
- **MINUS** hosting costs
- **MINUS** time spent on failed projects
- **MINUS** time spent learning and debugging

Most people talking about their "vibecoding income" conveniently forget to subtract their expenses.

## The Common Problems

### 1. The SaaS Trap

Everyone wants to conquer the market with another SaaS solution. Everyone wants to monetize their ideas immediately.

**What actually happens:**
- Poorly coded mobile website
- Already shouting "close to beta!"
- Asking for money before proving value
- Domain registered weeks ago
- Dead or unmaintained within months

**Why they fail:**
- Website isn't maintainable with Lovable for real traffic
- Hosting costs kill any profits
- No product-market fit
- Built to monetize, not to solve problems

### 2. The Maintenance Reality

When I re-check websites I saw being built 2-3 months ago:
- Most are dead
- Many are out of maintenance
- Hosting costs exceeded expectations
- The tech stack couldn't scale
- Founders moved on to the "next big idea"

## A Different Approach

Not all vibecoding projects fail. Take my example: [pagespeedpdf.com](https://pagespeedpdf.com)

- **Purpose:** Convert PageSpeed reports to PDF/Markdown
- **Monetization:** None. Built it for myself.
- **Traffic:** ~1,000 visits per week
- **Downloads:** ~70 per week
- **Success Factor:** Solved a real problem, not built to monetize

## The Alternative Path

Instead of chasing SaaS dreams, consider:

### Building for Real Businesses
- Local plumbers, electricians, barbers
- They pay $300-700 per website
- It's not sexy or viral
- It's not "scalable" in the VC sense
- **But it works consistently**

### Why This Works
1. **Real customers with real budgets**
2. **Immediate payment** - no waiting for user acquisition
3. **Clear value exchange** - they need a website, you build it
4. **Sustainable** - businesses always need websites
5. **Repeatable** - once you have the process down, each site is profitable

## The Math That Actually Works

**Per Month:**
- Build 2 websites @ $500 each = $1,000
- Time: 8-12 hours total
- Tool costs: ~$50-100/month
- Net profit: ~$900

**Not sexy, but sustainable.**

Compare this to:
- Spending 100 hours building a SaaS
- $200/month in tools and hosting
- 0 users after 3 months
- Net profit: -$600

## I'm Not Saying Your SaaS Will Fail

Your SaaS might succeed! But consider:
- Do you have product-market fit?
- Can you maintain it long-term?
- Are your hosting costs realistic at scale?
- Are you building to solve a problem or to monetize?

## The Takeaway

**Stop chasing the vibecoding dream. Start building a vibecoding business.**

The difference:
- **Dream:** Quick riches, passive income, viral growth
- **Business:** Consistent work, real clients, predictable income

Most people won't tell you this because:
1. It's not sexy enough to sell courses about
2. It requires actual work and client relationships
3. It's "boring" compared to launching the next hot SaaS

But if you want to actually make money with vibecoding - not just talk about it on Twitter - this is the path that works.
