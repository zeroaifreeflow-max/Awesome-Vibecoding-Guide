# Honorable Mentions 🏆

This section highlights tools that offer excellent value for developers seeking free or cost-effective alternatives to implement vibecoding workflows. While these tools may not have the same polish or feature completeness as my main stack, they provide solid foundations for getting started without financial commitment.

## IDE-Native AI Assistants

- **[Kilo Code](kilocode.md)** - Versatile multi-platform AI assistant with intelligent modes (Code/Architect/Ask/Debug/Orchestrator), flexible pricing (free/PAYG/BYOK), and dual support (VSCode + CLI). Excellent for developers who prefer IDE-centric workflows with visual feedback.

## Free & Cost-Effective Tools

- **[Qwen Coder / Qwen CLI](qwen-coder.md)** - Alibaba's free, open-source coding assistant with MCP support
- **[Gemini CLI](gemini-cli.md)** - Google's CLI with generous free tier and strong reasoning
- **[AmpCode](ampcode.md)** - Free tier coding assistance with MCP support
- **[TRAE](trae.md)** - Cost-effective prompt-based pricing model
- **[Octofriend](octofriend.md)** - Open-source CLI with seamless Synthetic.new integration, excellent MCP support, and no rate limit headaches
- **[Ghostty](ghostty.md)** - Fast, lightweight terminal emulator as an alternative to system defaults and Warp
- **[iTerm2](iterm2.md)** - A powerful, customizable terminal emulator for macOS with AI integration.

## Native Integration Tools

- **[GitHub Copilot](github-copilot.md)** - Good value at $10 for 300 prompts + unlimited GPT-4o-mini; free for students; VS Code native but limited for heavy vibecoding

## Tools I Dropped — Honest Assessments

These are tools I personally used in production and decided to drop from my workflow. I'm including them in honorable mentions because they're worth knowing about, and my experience can help you make informed decisions.

- **[OpenSpec CLI](openspec-cli.md)** - Specification-driven development framework (replaced: excellent tool, but Clavix offers faster CLEAR-based PRD generation with better AI agent integration)
- **[Traycer.ai](traycer.md)** - AI-powered development planning and validation (dropped: too slow, costly, frustration with hallucinations)
- **[GitHub Speckit](github-speckit.md)** - GitHub's native specification tool (dropped: too heavyweight for fast-paced vibecoding, prefer Clavix for PRD generation)
- **[Cline / Roo Code](cline-roo.md)** - VSCode plugins for GUI-based vibecoding with GLM/Synthetic.new integration (dropped: unnecessary complexity, tool/MCP call reliability issues)

### Why Share Dropped Tools?
These tools aren't failures—they're valuable products that didn't fit my specific vibecoding workflow. By sharing honest assessments based on real production experience, I can help you:
- **Avoid costly mistakes**: Learn from my experience before investing money and time
- **Make informed choices**: Understand the trade-offs between different approaches
- **Find better alternatives**: Discover more cost-effective or faster solutions
- **Recognize use cases**: Some of these tools might be perfect for your specific needs even if they didn't fit mine

The goal is transparency: showing not just what works, but also what I tried and why I moved on.
