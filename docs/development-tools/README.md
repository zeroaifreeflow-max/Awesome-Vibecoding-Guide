## Quick Start Guide

### When to Use This Guide
This tool stack is designed for **Phase 0-2** of the vibecoding workflow:
- [Phase 0: Vibecoder Preparation](../workflow/phase-0-vibecoder-preparation.md) - Initial tool selection
- [Phase 1: Planning](../workflow/phase-1-planning.md) - Clavix PRD generation
- [Phase 2: Development](../workflow/phase-2-development.md) - Daily coding workflow

### 1. Essential Setup (Phase 0)
Start with the core stack for optimal vibecoding experience:
1. Install [Zed](./recommended-tools/zed.md) as your primary IDE
2. Set up [Claude Code CLI](./recommended-tools/claude-code-cli.md) as your primary coding agent
3. Configure [Context7 MCP](./mcp-servers/context7-mcp.md) for documentation access
4. Add [DevTools MCP](./mcp-servers/devtools-mcp.md) for testing capabilities
5. Install [Sequential Thinking MCP](./mcp-servers/sequential-thinking-mcp.md) for enhanced problem-solving
6. Set up [Task Manager MCP](./mcp-servers/task-manager-mcp.md) for persistent workflow management
7. Add [Shadcn MCP](./mcp-servers/shadcn-mcp.md) for professional UI component access
8. (Optional) Install [Droid CLI](./recommended-tools/droid-cli.md) for spec-driven projects

### 2. Configuration
- Configure API keys for your preferred LLM providers
- Set up essential MCP servers:
  - [Sequential Thinking MCP](./mcp-servers/sequential-thinking-mcp.md) for structured analysis
  - [Task Manager MCP](./mcp-servers/task-manager-mcp.md) for task persistence
  - [Shadcn MCP](./mcp-servers/shadcn-mcp.md) for UI components
- Review [compatibility guidelines](./compatibility.md) for optimal integration

### 3. Workflow Integration
These tools are designed to work together seamlessly:
- Use Zed for editing and development
- Leverage Claude Code CLI for AI-assisted coding (primary agent)
- Use Droid CLI for spec-driven projects and team coordination
- Access documentation via Context7 MCP
- Test and debug with DevTools MCP
- Enhance problem-solving with Sequential Thinking MCP
- Manage tasks persistently with Task Manager MCP
- Build professional UIs with Shadcn MCP components

## Tool Philosophy

### Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)
All primary tools support external API integration, providing:
- **Cost Efficiency**: Use your preferred LLM providers
- **Flexibility**: Switch between models based on task complexity
- **Privacy**: Keep your data and API keys secure

### MCP Integration
Enhanced development through external data sources:
- **Context Awareness**: Real-time access to relevant documentation
- **Tool Orchestration**: Seamless integration between development tools
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new tools and capabilities

### Performance Focus
Tools selected for:
- **Speed**: Fast response times and minimal latency
- **Reliability**: Stable performance under various workloads
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for rapid development iterations

## Migration from Other Tools
