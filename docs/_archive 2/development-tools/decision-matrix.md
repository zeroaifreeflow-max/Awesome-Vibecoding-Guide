# Tool Selection Decision Matrix

## Philosophy Reminder

This guide operates on a **cost-effectiveness principle**:
- **Target:** 80-99% of functionality at free or low cost
- **Source of truth:** This guide itself (proven in commercial production)
- **Approach:** Start free, upgrade only when justified by clear ROI

**The expensive-tool trap:**
- $200/month Claude Code subscription isn't necessary for most freelancers
- Free/budget tools can deliver professional results
- Cost savings compound quickly (save $2,400/year = client you don't need to find)

**When this guide differs from popular advice:**
- Popular advice says "use Cursor Pro" ($20/mo)
- This guide says "try Qwen CLI (free) first"
- **Reason:** Most developers never need the premium features

## Decision Framework

Use this four-factor framework when choosing tools:

### 1. Cost-Effectiveness
**Question:** What's the real cost per value delivered?

**Calculation:**
```
Cost-effectiveness = (Features you'll actually use × Reliability) / Total cost
```

**Example:**
- **Claude Code:** $200/mo, 100 features, use 20 → 20/200 = 0.1
- **Qwen CLI:** Free, 40 features, use 30 → 30/0 = ∞

**Winner:** Often the simpler, cheaper tool

### 2. Feature Completeness
**Question:** Does it have what I actually need (not what sounds cool)?

**Essential features checklist:**
- ✅ Code generation
- ✅ Context awareness
- ✅ File editing
- ✅ Error understanding
- ✅ Multi-file refactoring (nice to have)

**Premium features (rarely needed):**
- ❌ Voice coding
- ❌ Real-time collaboration
- ❌ Advanced analytics
- ❌ Team management

### 3. Reliability
**Question:** Does it work consistently when I need it?

**Reliability factors:**
- Uptime (API availability)
- Error handling
- Rate limiting
- Local fallback options

**Red flags:**
- Frequent "Rate limit exceeded" errors
- API downtime during your work hours
- No offline mode
- Vague error messages

### 4. Integration
**Question:** Does it fit my existing workflow?

**Integration checklist:**
- Works with my current IDE
- Supports my tech stack
- Compatible with my git workflow
- Doesn't require workflow changes
- Has escape hatches (not locked in)

- ROI calculation shows clear benefit

**ROI calculation (Pro tier):**
```
$15/month = $0.50/day
If GLM Pro saves you 30 minutes/day vs Lite limits
Your time worth $40/hour
Savings: (30/60) × $40 = $20/day
ROI: $20/day - $0.50/day = $19.50/day profit
```

### Claude Code ($200/month)

**Best for:**
- Agencies with multiple developers
- High-value enterprise projects
- Teams needing best-in-class AI
- Developers billing $150+/hour

**Pros:**
- ✅ Best code quality (Claude Sonnet 4)
- ✅ Excellent context understanding
- ✅ Native VS Code extension
- ✅ Advanced multi-file operations
- ✅ Very generous rate limits
- ✅ Professional support
- ✅ Enterprise features

**Cons:**
- ❌ Expensive ($200/mo = $2,400/year)
- ❌ Overkill for most freelancers
- ❌ Locked to Anthropic models
- ❌ No BYOK (bring your own key)
- ❌ VS Code only

**When to use:**
- You bill $150+/hour and work 40+ hours/week
- You're an agency billing clients for AI assistance
- You work on complex, high-value projects
- You can expense it as business cost
- You need the absolute best code quality

**When NOT to use:**
- You're a hobbyist
- You're a freelancer billing < $100/hour
- You're building side projects
- You can't directly bill clients for it
- You're cost-conscious

**ROI calculation:**
```
$200/month = $6.67/day (working days)
If Claude Code saves you 30 minutes/day vs. GLM
Your time worth $150/hour
Savings: (30/60) × $150 = $75/day
ROI: $75/day - $6.67/day = $68.33/day profit ✅

But if your time is worth $50/hour:
Savings: (30/60) × $50 = $25/day
ROI: $25/day - $6.67/day = $18.33/day profit
Annual: $18.33 × 250 = $4,582
Is this worth it? Maybe not if GLM gives you 90% of the value for $15/mo.
```

Total: $20-25/month
```

**When to choose Tier 2:**
- You value IDE integration highly
- You want multi-model access
- $20/mo easily justified by your revenue

### Agency (Budget: $50-100/month)

**Profile:**
- Team of 2-4 developers
- Billing multiple clients
- Revenue: $20,000-50,000/month

**Recommended stack (per developer):**
```
IDE: Cursor ($20/mo) or Claude Code ($200/mo)
AI: Included with IDE
Hosting: Cloudflare Pages (free) or Pro ($20/mo)
Monitoring: Paid tier ($20-50/mo)
Total per dev: $40-270/month
Team of 3: $120-810/month
```

**Which to choose:**
- **Claude Code ($200/mo)** if:
  - Working on complex projects
  - AI cost is billable to clients
  - Quality is paramount
  - Developers bill $150+/hour

- **Cursor ($20/mo)** if:
  - Budget-conscious agency
  - Developers bill $75-150/hour
  - Good balance needed

**ROI calculation (Claude Code):**
```
Cost: $200/month per developer
If AI saves 10 hours/month
Developer cost: $75/hour (fully loaded)
Savings: 10 × $75 = $750
ROI: $750 - $200 = $550 profit
Annual per dev: $550 × 12 = $6,600
Team of 3: $19,800/year profit
```

**Verdict:** ✅ Easily justified for agencies

### When Expensive Tools Make Sense

**Claude Code ($200/mo) is justified when:**

1. **You bill $150+/hour** and work full-time
   - Savings exceed cost by 10x+
   - Cost is negligible vs. revenue

2. **Working on enterprise/complex projects**
   - Code quality is critical
   - Mistakes are expensive
   - Client expects best results

3. **Agency with billable AI costs**
   - Include AI tools in project quotes
   - Client pays for the tooling
   - Zero effective cost to you

4. **You need specific features**
   - Advanced VS Code integration
   - Enterprise support
   - Team features

**When Claude Code is NOT justified:**

1. **You're a hobbyist** - Use free tools
2. **Freelancer billing < $100/hour** - GLM or Cursor better ROI
3. **Can't directly expense it** - Hard to justify $2,400/year
4. **Side projects** - Way overkill
5. **Learning/education** - Free tools are fine
