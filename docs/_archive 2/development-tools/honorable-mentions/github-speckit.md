# GitHub Speckit

## Overview
GitHub Speckit is GitHub's native specification tool designed to help developers create comprehensive project specifications and manage development workflows. It integrates directly with GitHub repositories and provides structured approaches to project planning and execution.

## Key Strengths
- **Excellent for New Projects**: Outstanding tool for kickstarting new projects from scratch with clean, well-structured foundations
- **Recent Improvements**: After recent updates, shows promising capabilities for vibecoding workflows
- **Clean Architecture**: Forces good practices and creates well-organized project structures
- **Ideal for Complex Projects**: Solid choice for complex, large-scale projects with many different features
- **Branch-Based Workflow**: Enforces best practices by requiring branch-based development workflows
- **Native Integration**: Seamless integration with GitHub's ecosystem

## Best Use Cases
- Starting new projects from scratch that need solid architectural foundations
- Large-scale initiatives with multiple features and complex requirements
- Collaborative projects where structure and organization are paramount
- Teams that value comprehensive specifications over rapid iteration
- Projects where clean, well-documented architecture is a priority

## Limitations
- **Overly Complex Specifications**: Creates unnecessarily complicated specs for simple projects
- **Slower Workflow**: Way more complex compared to OpenSpec for rapid development
- **Integration Difficulties**: Not easily integrated with existing projects and repositories
- **Pace Mismatch**: Better suited for larger-scale initiatives, but too heavyweight for fast-paced, vibe-led development
- **Learning Curve**: Requires investment to understand and use effectively
- **Flexibility Trade-off**: Rigid structure can hinder rapid experimentation

## Why I Dropped It
After using GitHub Speckit in various projects, I found that while it excels at creating comprehensive specifications for new projects, it doesn't align well with fast-paced vibecoding workflows. The tool adds complexity and overhead that slows down iteration speed. For existing projects, integration is challenging and often not worth the effort. OpenSpec emerged as the clear winner for my workflow needs.

**The verdict**: While GitHub Speckit definitely has value, especially for collaborative projects or larger initiatives, OpenSpec is significantly faster to use and enables rapid progression through development tasks. Additionally, OpenSpec can be easily integrated into existing projects and repositories, whereas GitHub Speckit makes this integration challenging.

## When to Use GitHub Speckit Instead
Despite dropping it from my main workflow, GitHub Speckit remains valuable for:
- **Green-field projects**: Starting entirely new projects where comprehensive planning is valuable
- **Large teams**: Collaborative environments where everyone needs clear, structured specifications
- **Complex systems**: Projects with intricate architectures requiring detailed documentation
- **Formal processes**: Organizations that require comprehensive spec documentation

## Alternative Recommendation
For fast-paced vibecoding workflows:
- **OpenSpec**: Provides the speed and flexibility needed for rapid development
- **Easy integration**: Works seamlessly with existing projects
- **Lighter weight**: Less overhead while maintaining quality

Note: These tools have different strengths. GitHub Speckit is more comprehensive but slower; OpenSpec is faster but less formal. Choose based on your project's needs and pace.
