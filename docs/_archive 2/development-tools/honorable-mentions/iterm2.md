# iTerm2 — The Power User's Terminal

## Overview
iTerm2 is a terminal emulator for macOS that does amazing things. It's a replacement for Apple's Terminal app, but it's much more powerful. For developers who love to tinker and customize every aspect of their tools, iTerm2 offers a playground of features. It's an alternative to modern terminals like Warp and Ghostty, especially for those who prioritize granular control over a minimalist interface.

## Key Strengths
- **Deep Customization**: Almost every aspect of the terminal can be tweaked, from the appearance to the behavior of the cursor.
- **Rich Feature Set**: Split panes, hotkey windows, search, autocomplete, and much more.
- **AI Integration**: Built-in AI chat that can interact with your terminal sessions.
- **Shell Integration**: Deep integration with your shell to track command history, current directory, and more.
- **Mature and Stable**: A long history of development means it's a reliable tool.

## Best Use Cases
- Developers who want complete control over their terminal environment.
- Users who need advanced features like triggers, automatic profile switching, and inline images.
- A good choice for those who find Warp or Ghostty too restrictive or opinionated.
- Data-heavy workflows where customization and scripting are key.

## Limitations
- **Overwhelming for Newcomers**: The sheer number of options can be daunting.
- **Dated UI**: The interface is not as modern or clean as some of the newer terminals.
- **macOS Only**: Not available on other platforms.
