# Factory AI 🏭

Factory AI is a cost-effective AI platform offering competitive token pricing with superior optimization through intelligent caching. The platform provides access to various models including GPT-5-high and specialized codex models at significantly reduced costs.

## Key Advantages

### 🚀 Superior Token Efficiency
While Factory AI plans offer 20M tokens per month on paper, the actual usage is 10-20x more efficient due to:
- Advanced caching mechanisms
- Superior optimization algorithms
- Reduced token waste in conversations

### 💰 Competitive Pricing
The platform offers exceptional value, especially with:
- **Codex models at 0.5x token price** - perfect for code generation and development
- **$20/month plan** provides substantial capacity for serious development work

### 🛠️ Integration with Development Tools
Factory AI pairs exceptionally well with:
- **[Droid CLI](../../development-tools/recommended-tools/droid-cli.md)** - Native support allows for extensive coding workflows
- **[GLM-4.6](../glm-coding-plan.md)** - Use for development phases while saving more expensive models for planning

## Real-World Performance

### Case Study: Catering Website Development
A complex catering website was built using:
- **GPT-5-high** for planning and feature design
- **GPT-codex** for actual development

**Project Features:**
- Semi-complicated catering website
- 2 complex forms with validation
- Order-via-form system implementation
- Started with OpenSpec for requirements

**Results:**
- Entire project completed with 16M tokens used
- 4M tokens remaining from the 20M monthly allocation
- Demonstrates the real-world efficiency of the platform

## Strategic Workflow

Factory AI excels as a cost-effective foundation for hybrid workflows:

1. **Planning Phase**: Use Factory AI's models (or frontier models) to create comprehensive plans and generate `.md` files
2. **Development Phase**: Deploy different LLMs for implementation while maintaining cost control
3. **Iteration Cycle**: Use codex models for rapid prototyping and testing

The $20/month investment becomes a strategic asset for developers who want to leverage multiple models without breaking the bank.
