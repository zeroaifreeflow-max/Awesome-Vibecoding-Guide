# Mistral AI

## Overview
Mistral AI is a leading European AI lab that champions open-weight models and efficient computing. They have recently made waves in the developer community with their **Devstral** line of coding models and the **Mistral Vibe CLI**. While they offer paid API tiers, their current "Experiment Plan" makes them a top-tier contender for free vibecoding.

## The Experiment Plan: Free Vibecoding 🧪

Mistral offers a unique **Experiment Plan** that allows developers to use their API for free.

**How it works:**
- **Free API Access**: Access to Mistral's models without credit card requirements.
- **The Trade-off**: In exchange for free access, your API requests (inputs and outputs) may be used to train Mistral's models.
- **Requirements**: You only need a verified phone number (one per plan).

This "data for compute" model is an excellent option for developers who are comfortable with their coding data being used for training in exchange for accessing state-of-the-art models for free.

### How to Activate
1. Go to the [Mistral AI Studio subscription page](https://console.mistral.ai/upgrade/plans).
2. Select **"Experiment for free"**.
3. Verify your phone number.
4. Accept the terms regarding data training.

## Models Available

The Experiment Plan gives you access to Mistral's powerful coding models:

- **Devstral 2 (123B)**: A state-of-the-art open model for code agents. It achieves 72.2% on SWE-bench Verified, making it highly capable for complex coding tasks.
- **Devstral Small 2 (24B)**: A highly efficient, smaller model perfect for faster responses and lower latency tasks.

## Comparison: Mistral vs. The Rest

Mistral's Experiment Plan places it squarely alongside other top "free" options like Gemini and Qwen, but with a unique value prop.

| Feature | Mistral Experiment | Gemini Free | Qwen (Factory/Free) |
|---------|--------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Cost** | **Free** | Free | Free |
| **Model Quality** | **SOTA Open (Devstral 2)** | High (Flash/Pro) | High (Qwen 2.5) |
| **Privacy** | **Data used for training** | Data used for training | Varies (often used) |
| **Requirements** | Phone Number | Google Account | API Key / Account |
| **Best For** | **Open Source Advocates** | General Purpose | Budget Devs |

**Why choose Mistral?**
- You want to support the open-weight ecosystem.
- You specifically want models optimized for *agentic* workflows (Devstral is built for this).
- You want a dedicated CLI tool ([Mistral Vibe](../../development-tools/recommended-tools/mistral-vibe-cli.md)) that is built by the same team as the model.

## Best Use Cases
- **Budget Vibecoding**: Getting high-quality AI assistance without a monthly subscription.
- **Learning & Experimentation**: Trying out agentic workflows without financial commitment.
- **Open Source Contribution**: Using a tool that contributes back to the open model ecosystem.

## Recommendation
Mistral AI is an **Honorable Mention** that is quickly becoming a primary recommendation for budget-conscious developers. If you are willing to trade your data for free compute, the Devstral 2 model is powerful enough to drive serious development work.
