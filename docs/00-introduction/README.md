# Introduction

> What vibecoding is, who this guide is for, and how to use it.

## What Is Vibecoding?

Vibecoding is AI-assisted development where you describe what you want, and AI helps you build it. But this guide isn't about the hype — it's about making money.

**The reality:**
- AI doesn't replace skill — it amplifies it
- Technique matters more than which model you use
- Budget tools can produce professional results
- The business model matters more than the technology

## Who This Guide Is For

**This guide is for practitioners who want income, not tool tourists.**

You should read this if you:
- Want to make real money with AI-assisted development
- Are tired of "build a SaaS" advice that never works
- Need a proven, repeatable business model
- Want to work smarter, not just faster

This guide is NOT for you if:
- You want to catalog every AI tool
- You're looking for get-rich-quick schemes
- You don't want to do real work for real clients

## The Core Principle

> **Technique > Model**

The LLM behind your vibecoding doesn't matter as much as:
- Your methodology and workflow
- How you scope and plan projects
- Your quality standards
- Your business model

With proper technique, even free/budget models deliver professional results.
