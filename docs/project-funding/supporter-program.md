## Common Questions

### "Is Patreon worth the fees?"

For most creators, yes. The platform handles:
- Payment processing
- Tax documentation
- Membership management
- Content gating

8% + fees is reasonable for this value.

### "How much content should I create?"

**Minimum:**
- 4 exclusive posts/month
- 1 monthly video/update
- Weekly community engagement

**Recommended:**
- 8+ exclusive posts/month
- 2+ videos/month
- Weekly community calls (higher tiers)

### "What if I can't maintain the schedule?"

**Solutions:**
1. Create content buffer before launch
2. Batch create content
3. Use lower tiers for less frequent content
4. Communicate transparently about changes
5. Adjust tiers to match capacity
