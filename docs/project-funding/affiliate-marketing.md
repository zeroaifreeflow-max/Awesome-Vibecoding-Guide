- [ ] Recommend poor-quality products
- [ ] Hide affiliate relationships
- [ ] Make false claims
- [ ] Overwhelm with affiliate links
- [ ] Prioritize commission over value

### Best Practices

**Transparency:**
1. Tell readers about affiliate relationships upfront
2. Explain how recommendations are made
3. Share your actual experience with products

**Value First:**
1. Solve the reader's problem first

3. If a free alternative exists, mention it
4. Provide additional resources

**Honesty:**

2. Mention if you haven't used a feature

4. Remove recommendations when products decline
