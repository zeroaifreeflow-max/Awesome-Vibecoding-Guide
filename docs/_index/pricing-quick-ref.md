## Value-Based Pricing Formula

```
Client Value = (Time Saved x Hourly Rate) + Revenue Increase + Cost Reduction
Your Price = 10-20% of Client Value
```

**Example:**

- Time saved: 5 hrs/week x $50/hr x 52 = $13,000/year
- Revenue increase: 10% more leads = $6,000/year
- Cost reduction: $100/mo hosting saved = $1,200/year
- **Total value: $20,200/year → Price at $2,000-3,000**
