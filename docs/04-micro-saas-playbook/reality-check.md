# Micro-SaaS Reality Check

> Most micro-SaaS products fail. Here's why, and when it actually makes sense.

## Why Most Fail

**Building before validating.** The #1 killer. You spend months on something nobody wants. The code works perfectly; the business doesn't.

**"If I build it, they will come."** They won't. Nobody knows your product exists. Nobody cares. Distribution is the real challenge—not building.

**Underestimating distribution.** You need a way to reach customers repeatedly and cheaply. Without this, you'll burn cash on ads with nothing to show.

**Support burden eating profits.** 50 customers at $20/month = $1,000 MRR. If 10 of them email you weekly with issues, you've bought yourself a part-time job that pays $12/hour.

**Feature creep.** Every customer wants something different. You add features to please them. The product becomes bloated, hard to maintain, impossible to explain.

## When Micro-SaaS Makes Sense

✅ **You've validated demand first.** Real people have paid money or made strong commitments. Not "that sounds cool"—actual transactions.

✅ **You have distribution.** An audience. A network. A community where you can reach potential customers without paying for every click.

✅ **The problem is painful enough to pay for.** "Nice to have" doesn't convert. "This is costing me hours every week" does.

✅ **You can reach customers cheaply.** SEO, content, community presence, word of mouth. If customer acquisition costs more than a few months of their subscription, the math doesn't work.

## When to Avoid

❌ **No validation.** Just an idea you think is good. Your opinion doesn't count—the market's does.

❌ **Crowded market.** 50 competitors with funding, teams, and established user bases. You're bringing a knife to a gunfight.

❌ **Low willingness to pay.** Some problems people want solved for free. Consumer apps, commoditized tools, anything where free alternatives dominate.

❌ **You just want to build.** Building is fun. Running a SaaS business is not always fun. If you want to code, contribute to open source. If you want a business, you need to want the business part too.

## Better Alternatives

If you're not ready for SaaS, consider these first:

### Start with Services
Build websites, automations, or custom tools for clients. You learn what people actually pay for. Cash flow starts immediately.

### Build SaaS from Client Work Patterns
After 5-10 similar client projects, you'll spot patterns. "I keep building this same thing." That's your validated SaaS idea.

### Validate with a Paid Pilot
Before building software, deliver the outcome manually. Charge for it. If people pay for the manual version, they'll pay for the automated version.

## The Honest Math

Let's say you want $2,000/month from a SaaS:

| Price Point | Customers Needed | Difficulty |
|------------|------------------|------------|
| $9/month | 222 customers | Very hard to acquire |
| $29/month | 69 customers | Hard |
| $49/month | 41 customers | Achievable |
| $99/month | 21 customers | Most realistic |

Higher prices attract more serious customers who churn less and complain less. Don't compete on price.

## Bottom Line

Micro-SaaS works when you validate first, have distribution, and solve a painful problem. For everyone else, start with services. Build your SaaS from patterns you discover in client work.

The goal is a profitable business, not a perfect product.
