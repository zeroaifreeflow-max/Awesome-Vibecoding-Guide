# Validation-First Workflow

> Pre-sell before you build. Money talks; opinions don't.

## The Validation Rule

Before writing a single line of code:

1. **Find 10 people with the problem.** Not 10 friends. 10 strangers who experience this pain regularly.
2. **Get 3 to pay upfront.** Or make strong commitments with deadlines. Real skin in the game.
3. **Only then build.** You now have customers waiting, not an audience to find.

This feels backward. It's not. It's the only way to avoid building something nobody wants.

## What Counts as Validation

### ✅ Real Validation

- **Money exchanged.** Pre-orders, deposits, first month paid in advance.
- **Strong commitment with deadline.** "I'll pay $X when you launch by [date]."
- **Paid pilots.** They're paying you to solve the problem manually while you build.
- **Corporate purchase intent.** Written confirmation from a budget holder.

### ❌ Fake Validation

- "That sounds cool." (Means nothing)
- Email signups without payment. (Low-commitment signal)
- Friends saying they'd use it. (They're being nice)
- Upvotes on Product Hunt. (Curiosity, not buying intent)
- Twitter likes. (Entertainment, not business validation)

## Validation Methods

### Landing Page + Pre-Sale

Create a simple page explaining the problem and solution:
- What pain point you're solving
- How your solution works (conceptually)
- Price and "Pre-order" button
- Stripe checkout for payment

If people pay before the product exists, you've validated. If they don't, you've saved months of building.

### Cold Outreach Conversations

Find people who might have the problem:
1. Reach out (email, LinkedIn, communities)
2. Ask about their workflow, not your idea
3. Listen for pain points
4. If it matches, pitch the solution
5. Ask for a commitment

Script: "I'm building X to solve Y. If I have it ready by [date], would you pay $Z for it?"

### Paid Pilots (Manual First)

Deliver the outcome by hand before automating:
1. Find 3-5 potential customers
2. Offer to solve their problem manually for a fee
3. Do the work yourself (or with tools)
4. Collect payment and feedback
5. Build the software to automate what you just did

This validates demand AND teaches you what to build.

### Waitlist with Deposit

If full pre-sales feel too aggressive:
1. Collect email + small refundable deposit ($5-20)
2. Promise early access and discount at launch
3. Deposits show intent; emails don't

## Building in Public

Share your validation journey:

- **Post progress updates.** Problems you're solving, conversations you're having.
- **Share learnings.** What worked, what didn't.
- **Ask for feedback.** On landing pages, positioning, features.
- **Be honest about struggles.** Authenticity builds trust.

Benefits:
- Builds audience for launch day
- Creates accountability
- Attracts early customers who want to follow along
- Gets feedback before you're too invested

## Kill Criteria

Know when to abandon an idea:

### Red Flags

- 50+ conversations, zero payment commitments
- "I'd use this if it were free" (it won't be)
- Only competitors' users are interested (they won't switch)
- Can't explain the problem in one sentence
- You're the only person excited about it

### When to Pivot

- Same audience, different problem (their pain is elsewhere)
- Same problem, different audience (these people won't pay, others might)
- Smaller scope (the full vision is too big—what's the core?)

### When to Persist

- Payment commitments exist but slow
- The problem is real but you haven't found the right buyers
- Feedback is specific and actionable

## Validation Timeline

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Problem research, find 20 potential customers |
| 2 | Outreach, 10+ conversations |
| 3 | Landing page, pre-sale offers |
| 4 | Decision: build, pivot, or kill |

If you can't validate in 4 weeks, the idea probably isn't strong enough.

## Bottom Line

Validation isn't optional—it's the foundation. Three paying customers before launch is worth more than a thousand email signups after.

The goal isn't to build something. The goal is to build something people pay for.
