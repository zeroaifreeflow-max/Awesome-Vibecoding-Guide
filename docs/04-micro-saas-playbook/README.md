# Micro-SaaS Playbook

> Build small, focused software products that solve one pain point — validation-first approach.

## What Is Micro-SaaS?

Small SaaS products with:
- **One core feature** — Solves one specific problem exceptionally well
- **Low overhead** — You can run it solo or with minimal help
- **Subscription revenue** — Monthly recurring income
- **Niche focus** — Serves a specific audience, not everyone

## Reality Check

Before diving in, understand:
- ❌ Most SaaS ideas fail (validation is everything)
- ❌ Building is the easy part; distribution is hard
- ❌ Support burden can kill your time
- ✅ Pre-selling validates before you build
- ✅ Niche products can be very profitable
- ✅ Vibecoding makes MVPs fast and cheap

## Playbook Contents

1. **[Micro-SaaS Reality Check](reality-check.md)** — When to do it (and when not)
2. **[Validation-First Workflow](validation-first.md)** — Pre-sell, waitlists, paid pilots
3. **[MVP Build System](mvp-build-system.md)** — Thin vertical slice, constraints
4. **[Pricing, Billing & Churn](pricing-billing-churn.md)** — Tiers, annual plans, churn control

## The Validation-First Rule

**Never build before validating:**
1. Find 10 people with the problem
2. Get 3 of them to pay upfront (or commit)
3. Only then build the MVP

## Quick Stats

- **Time to validate**: 1-4 weeks
- **Time to MVP**: 2-4 weeks (after validation)
- **Price range**: $9-99/month per user
- **Break-even**: Usually 20-50 paying customers
