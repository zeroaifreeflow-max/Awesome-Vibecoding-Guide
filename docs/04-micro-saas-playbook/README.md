# Micro-SaaS Playbook

> Build small, focused tools that solve one pain point — for clients you already have.

## What Is Micro-SaaS (Our Way)?

Tiny software products built for existing clients:
- **One core feature** — Solves one specific problem exceptionally well
- **Client-funded** — Built for a client who already pays you
- **Pain you've seen** — Not guessed, observed during delivery
- **Low overhead** — You can run it solo or with minimal help

## The Client-First Difference

**Traditional SaaS thinking:**
- Build a product → Find customers → Market and sell → Compete

**Our approach:**
- Deliver websites/automations → Observe client pain → Propose a tool → Get paid to build it

You already have distribution. You already have trust. Skip the marketing.

## When to Build Micro-SaaS

Build when you notice a client:
- Paying for expensive software they barely use
- Managing something manually (spreadsheets, paper, phone calls)
- Complaining about a tool that's too complex
- Doing repetitive tasks that could be automated

**Example:** Your car mechanic client uses a $200/month booking system but only needs:
- Available time slots per day
- Clients can book open slots
- Admin can edit availability
- Booked slots don't show

Build that for $150/month. They save money. You earn recurring revenue.

## The Economics

| Factor | Traditional SaaS | Client-First Micro-SaaS |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Finding customers | Hard (marketing) | Easy (you have them) |
| Validation | Weeks/months | One conversation |
| First revenue | 3-6 months | Immediately |
| Risk | High | Low |
| Support burden | Many strangers | One client you know |

### Typical Pricing

- **Setup fee**: $500-2,000 (one-time build)
- **Monthly fee**: $50-300/month (hosting + support)
- **Alternative**: Flat $100-500/month all-in

Compare to what they're paying now. If they spend $200/month on Calendly/Acuity for basic booking, offer your simple version for $100/month.

## Reality Check

Micro-SaaS isn't for everyone:

- ✅ You already have clients (websites, automations)
- ✅ You've seen their pain points firsthand
- ✅ You can build and maintain software
- ✅ You want recurring revenue without marketing

- ❌ You don't have clients yet → Start with websites
- ❌ You want to compete in markets → Different guide
- ❌ You can't handle ongoing support → Stick to projects

## When NOT to Build

- Client wants something complex (ERP, CRM, full app)
- You'd need multiple customers to make it worthwhile
- The pain point isn't causing real money loss
- Off-the-shelf solutions work fine (don't reinvent)

## The Progression

Most builders follow this path:

1. **Websites** → Build skills, get clients
2. **Automations** → See their workflows, learn their pain
3. **Micro-SaaS** → Propose tiny tools for problems you've observed

The best Micro-SaaS ideas come from client work. You don't need to find customers — you need to listen to the ones you have.
