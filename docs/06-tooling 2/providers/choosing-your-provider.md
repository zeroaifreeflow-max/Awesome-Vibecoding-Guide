# Choosing Your AI Provider

## Introduction

Selecting the right AI provider is crucial for an effective vibecoding workflow. This guide helps you navigate the landscape of AI model providers, comparing costs, features, privacy, and use cases to find the perfect fit for your needs and budget.

The AI provider landscape has matured significantly, offering options from budget-friendly to enterprise-grade. Whether you're a hobbyist working on side projects or a professional developer building commercial applications, there's a provider that matches your requirements.

**Key factors to consider:**
- **Budget**: What can you afford monthly?
- **Privacy**: Are you working with sensitive or proprietary code?
- **Rate Limits**: How intensively will you use the AI assistant?
- **Model Variety**: Do you need access to multiple models for different tasks?
- **Integration**: Which development tools (Claude Code CLI, Droid CLI, etc.) will you use?

## My Dual-Provider Workflow

I use a two-provider setup that balances cost-effectiveness with flexibility:

1. **[GLM Coding Plan](glm-coding-plan.md)** — Primary daily driver
   - GLM-4.6 for most everyday coding tasks
   - Reliable, fast, cost-effective
   - [Sign up with 10% discount](https://z.ai/subscribe?ic=CUEFJ9ALMX)

2. **[Synthetic.new](synthetic-new.md)** — Secondary for model flexibility
   - Switch to MiniMax for routine variety or faster responses
   - Switch to Kimi (thinking mode) for complex reasoning problems
   - [First month $10](https://synthetic.new/?referral=IDyp75aoQpW9YFt)

This dual-provider approach gives you the best of both worlds: a reliable default (GLM) and flexibility when you need different models (Synthetic).

## Model Selection Strategy

When you have access to multiple models (via Synthetic.new or multiple providers), here's how to choose:

### GLM-4.6 (Primary — via GLM Coding Plan)
**Best for:** Most everyday coding tasks, general development, routine work

- Your default choice for most tasks
- Reliable, fast, well-tested for vibecoding workflows
- Cost-effective with generous rate limits
- Excellent for: Feature development, refactoring, debugging, code review

### MiniMax (via Synthetic.new)
**Best for:** When you want variety or faster responses

- Good alternative when you want a different perspective
- Fast response times
- Works well for: Quick iterations, brainstorming alternatives, getting fresh takes

### Kimi Thinking Mode (via Synthetic.new)
**Best for:** Complex problems requiring deep reasoning

- Extended thinking capabilities for hard problems
- Better at: Architecture decisions, complex algorithms, multi-step reasoning
- Use when GLM's initial response isn't quite right
- Ideal for: Debugging tricky issues, system design, optimization problems

### When to Switch Models

| Situation | Model Choice |
|-----------|-------------|
| Routine coding, feature work | GLM-4.6 (default) |
| Need a fresh perspective | MiniMax |
| Complex architecture decisions | Kimi thinking |
| Debugging hard problems | Kimi thinking |
| Quick iterations and brainstorming | MiniMax |
| Cost-conscious development | GLM-4.6 |

**Workflow tip:** Start with GLM-4.6. If you're not getting the results you need after 2-3 attempts, switch to Kimi thinking for complex problems or MiniMax for a fresh perspective.

### 🎯 Tier 2: ~$11/month — Budget Friendly for Heavy Usage

**Primary Recommendation: GLM Lite + nanoGPT Combination**

**Strategy:**
1. **Primary**: GLM Coding Plan Lite ($11/month) — 120 prompts per 5 hours
2. **Backup**: [nanoGPT](honorable-mentions/nanogpt.md) ($8/month with [referral](https://nano-gpt.com/invite/UfrjxgDi) 5% off) — 60,000 requests/month

**How to use this combo:**
- Use GLM for majority of your work (reliable, fast, private)
- Switch to nanoGPT when you hit GLM limits
- nanoGPT acts as overflow capacity for heavy sessions

**Total Cost:** ~$11/month (if you only need GLM Lite) or ~$19/month (if adding nanoGPT)

**Important Drawbacks:**
- nanoGPT models are quantized at fp8 (slightly reduced quality)
- nanoGPT has privacy concerns (see [detailed analysis](honorable-mentions/nanogpt.md))
- Don't use nanoGPT for sensitive/proprietary code

**Best For:**
- Heavy users on tight budgets
- Developers who occasionally need burst capacity
- Projects where code will be public anyway
- Learning and experimentation

**Alternative:** Just stick with GLM Lite — for most users, paying for nanoGPT is unnecessary as GLM limits are generous

#### Claude Pro / Claude Code Max (~$20-100/month)

**The Premium Option — Worth Considering for High Budgets**

With the release of Claude Opus 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5, Claude models are genuinely SOTA (state-of-the-art) for agentic coding. However, cost matters:

**If you have ~$100/month to spend:**
- **Claude Code Max5 ($100/month)** is genuinely the top-tier option
- Access to Opus 4.5 — current best-in-class for complex agentic tasks
- Native Claude Code CLI integration without provider switching
- If money isn't a constraint, this is the "just works" premium choice

**If you have ~$20/month to spend:**
- Claude Pro subscription offers less value than GLM/Synthetic at similar price
- Tiny quota compared to alternatives
- Weekly rate limits (vs 5h rolling window)
- Better to use Claude Code CLI with GLM or Synthetic as provider

**Who should consider Claude subscriptions:**
- Developers with $100+ monthly budgets who want the absolute best
- Those who value native integration over cost optimization
- Users working on complex architecture problems where Opus 4.5 shines

**Who should skip it:**
- Hobbyists — spending $100/month on a hobby project makes no sense when GLM can deliver the same results
- Budget-conscious professionals — GLM/Kimi/MiniMax can deliver production projects at a fraction of the cost
- Most vibecoding practitioners — proper technique matters more than model choice

See [detailed analysis](honorable-mentions/claude-subscription.md) for comprehensive breakdown.

**Bottom line:** If you're not constrained by budget and want the best, Claude Code Max5 at $100/month is genuinely excellent. For everyone else, the dual-provider workflow (GLM + Synthetic) delivers comparable results at 70%+ lower cost.

### ⚡ Tier 4: ~$60/month — Power Users & Heavy Usage

**Primary Recommendation: [Synthetic.new Pro Plan](synthetic-new.md)**

- **Cost**: $60/month
- **Rate Limits**: 1,350 prompts per 5 hours (10x Standard)
- **Models**: All 20+ frontier models included
- **Privacy**: Excellent

**Why Synthetic Pro over GLM Max:**
- Same price point ($60)
- More than sufficient limits (1,350 vs 2,400)
- Multiple models vs single GLM model
- Better privacy with self-hosted infrastructure
- Faster performance (200 tokens/sec)

**Alternative: GLM Max Plan**
- **Cost**: $60/month
- **Rate Limits**: 2,400 prompts per 5 hours
- **Model**: GLM-4.6 only

**Only choose GLM Max if:**
- You genuinely need 2,400 prompts/5h (unlikely even with many agents)
- You prefer single-model consistency
- You don't value model variety

**Reality Check:**
Even on GLM Pro (600 prompts/5h), the author hasn't hit limits with multiple parallel agents. The 2,400 limit is overkill for 99% of users.

**Best For:**
- Professional development teams
- Agencies building for clients
- Developers working 8+ hours daily with AI
- Those running many parallel agents
- Mission-critical development workflows

**Cost Comparison:**
- Claude Code Max20: €200+ per month (with EU VAT)
- Codex Pro: €229 per month (EU with VAT)
- Synthetic Pro: $60 per month
- GLM Max: $60 per month

The value proposition is clear: comparable or better functionality at 70% lower cost.
