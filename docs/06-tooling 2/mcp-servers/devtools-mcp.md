# DevTools MCP — Testing & Debugging 🛠️

## Testing breakthrough
- 95% less context usage than Playwright
- Intelligent navigation for web development tests
- Automatic debugging: console logs, navigation, 500 errors

## Workflow
- Launch the MCP
- Inform the agent about issues
- The agent autonomously gathers data, debugs, and resolves

Pro tip: It’s more efficient to tell the LLM “use MCP” instead of writing a long debugging prompt.

Pro tip 2: For web development, it can even perform its own tests using Chrome DevTools MCP when prompted correctly.
